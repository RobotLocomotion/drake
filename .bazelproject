# This is the default project view file for CLion. It describes which
# directories and targets CLion should traverse when ingesting the Bazel build.
#
# Developers who only wish to work on a subset of Drake may maintain custom
# project views locally. The more narrowly scoped the project view, the faster
# CLion indexing will be. Restricted project views of general interest may also
# be committed to this directory, with file names of the form foo.bazelproject.
#
# Detailed documentation for the file format is available at
# https://ij.bazel.build/docs/project-views.html
