# Installation Prerequisites

These are dependencies that are not pulled in via Bazel and must be installed
on the OS itself.

For how to install Drake on your system, please see the
[Installation and Quickstart](https://drake.mit.edu/installation.html)
documentation.

If you are a developer wishing to add dependencies, please see the
[Jenkins pages for Updating Installation Prerequisites](
https://drake.mit.edu/jenkins.html#updating-installation-prerequisites).
