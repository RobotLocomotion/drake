These files are used by pydrake.geometry.SetupMeshcat() to configure a
Deepnote notebook to allow for MeshCat traffic to flow.  Refer to the
implementation in bindings/pydrake/_geometry_extra.py for details.

Even though these files are used on Ubuntu- or Debian-based systems,
we don't place them under drake/setup/ubuntu/... because they are not
relevant to most Drake users on Ubuntu -- they are only useful for the
Deepnote cloud hosting platform.
