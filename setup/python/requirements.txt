# This file does NOT describe the requirements for Drake itself, but for
# setting up the Python virtual environment that Drake will manage. It is used
# by Drake's @python, and also when preparing a virtual environment to support
# a Drake installation.
#
# This file will be generated by tools/workspace/python/venv_upgrade.
#
# The present contents are adequate to bootstrap the PDM installation, after
# which (the first subsequent time venv_upgrade is run) PDM itself will
# generate a complete list of its dependencies with pinned versions.
