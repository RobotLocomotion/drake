# This file describes does NOT describe the requirements for Drake itself, but
# for setting up the Python virtual environment that Drake will manage. It is
# used by Drake's @python, and also when preparing a virtual environment to
# support a Drake installation.
#
# Specific version pins in this file are updated automatically by
# tools/workspace/python/venv_upgrade.

# TODO(jeremy.nimmer) Ideally, we also would pin all of the dependencies of
# PDM here, but it's not obvious to me how to do that in a way which is easy to
# upgrade/re-pin over time.
