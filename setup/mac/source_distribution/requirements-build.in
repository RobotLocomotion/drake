# Packages that we are happy to take the most recent version any time we update.
# The versions of these packages are "locked" in the requirements-build.txt file

# in the binary_distribution requirements.

# (None)

# The following are constrained or pinned version of packages. Typically we
# shouldn't need constraints, so anything listed here must be accompanied by
# a comment explaining the need for the constraint.
