# Python(s) for building wheels.  These should be kept in sync with
# `python_targets` in `tools/wheel/wheel_builder/macos.py`.
#
# TODO(@aiden2244): Drake 1.40 was the last release that used MacStadium for
# wheels builds instead of AWS. For AWS, we intend to remove macOS provisioning
# from the builder, at which point this will become the only "source of truth".
# Meanwhile, we are updating this file in order to provide the expected needs
# for the AWS provisioned images. Soon we should a) remove macOS provisioning
# from the wheel builder, and b) remove this TODO, in that order.
