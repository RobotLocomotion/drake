# Python(s) for building wheels.  These should be kept in sync with
# `python_targets` in `tools/wheel/wheel_builder/macos.py`.
#
# TODO(@aiden2244): As of writing, we still support 3.11, however, Drake 1.40
# is slated to be the last version that supports 3.11, and also the last
# release that does not use AWS. Since the builder is still responsible for
# installing the requisite Python, this is okay. For AWS, however, we intend
# to remove macOS provisioning from the builder, at which point this will
# become the only "source of truth". Meanwhile, we are updating this file in
# order to provide the expected needs for the AWS provisioned images (which we
# don't expect to ever build 3.11 wheels). After 1.40 is released, we should
# a) drop Python 3.11, b) remove macOS provisioning from the wheel builder,
# and c) remove this TODO, in that order.
