   * @name         Methods for weighting state variable errors
   * @{
   * This group of methods describes how errors for state variables with
   * heterogeneous units are weighted in the context of error-controlled
   * integration. This is an advanced topic and most users can simply specify
   * desired accuracy and accept the default state variable weights.
   *
   * A collection of state variables is generally defined in heterogenous units
   * (e.g. length, angles, velocities, energy). Some of the state
   * variables cannot even be expressed in meaningful units, like
   * quaternions. Certain integrators provide an estimate of the absolute error
   * made in each state variable during an integration step. These errors must
   * be properly weighted to obtain an "accuracy" _with respect to each
   * particular variable_. These per-variable accuracy determinations can be
   * compared against the user's requirements and used to select an appropriate
   * size for the next step [Sherman 2011]. The weights are
   * normally determined automatically using the system's characteristic
   * dimensions, so *most users can stop reading now!* Custom weighting is
   * primarily useful for performance improvement; an optimal weighting would
   * allow an error-controlled integrator to provide the desired level of
   * accuracy across all state variables without wasting computation
   * achieving superfluous accuracy for some of those variables.
   *
   * Users interested in more precise control over state variable weighting may
   * use the methods in this group to access and modify weighting factors for
   * individual state variables. Changes to these weights can only be made prior
   * to integrator initialization or as a result of an event being triggered
   * and then followed by re-initialization.
   *
   * <h4>Relative versus absolute accuracy</h4>
   *
   * %State variable integration error, as estimated by an integrator, is an
   * absolute quantity with the same
   * units as the variable. At each time step we therefore need to determine
   * an absolute error that would be deemed "good enough", i.e. satisfies
   * the user's accuracy requirement. If a variable is maintained to a
   * *relative* accuracy then that "good enough" value is defined to be the
   * required accuracy `a` (a fraction like 0.001) times the current value of
   * the variable, as long as that value
   * is far from zero. For variables maintained to an *absolute* accuracy, or
   * relative variables that are at or near zero (where relative accuracy would
   * be undefined or too strict, respectively), we need a different way to
   * determine the "good enough" absolute error. The methods in this section
   * control how that absolute error value is calculated.
   *
   * <h4>How to choose weights</h4>
   *
   * The weight `wᵢ` for a state variable `xᵢ` should be
   * chosen so that the product `wᵢ * dxᵢ` is unitless, and in particular is 1
   * when `dxᵢ` represents a "unit effect" of state variable `xᵢ`; that is, the
   * change in `xᵢ` that produces a unit change in some quantity of interest in
   * the system being simulated. Why unity (1)? Aside from normalizing the
   * values, unity "grounds" the weighted error to the user-specified accuracy.
   * A weighting can be applied individually to each state variable, but
   * typically it is done approximately by combining the known type of the
   * variable (e.g. length, angle) with a "characteristic scale" for that
   * quantity. For example, if a "characteristic length" for the system being
   * simulated is 0.1 meters, and `x₀` is a length variable measured in meters,
   * then `w₀` should be 10 so that `w₀*dx₀=1` when `dx₀=0.1`. For angles
   * representing pointing accuracy (say a camera direction) we typically assume
   * a "characteristic angle" is one radian (about 60 degrees), so if x₁ is a
   * pointing direction then w₁=1 is an appropriate weight. We can now scale an
   * error vector `e=[dx₀ dx₁]` to a unitless fractional error vector
   * `f=[w₀*dx₀ w₁*dx₁]`. Now to achieve a given accuracy `a`, say `a=.0001`,
   * we need only check that `|fᵢ|<=a` for each element `i` of `f`. Further,
   * this gives us a quantitative measure of "worst accuracy" that we can use
   * to increase or reduce size of the next attempted step, so that we will just
   * achieve the required accuracy but not much more. We'll be more precise
   * about this below.
   *
   * <h4>Some subtleties for second-order dynamic systems</h4>
   *
   * Systems governed by 2nd-order differential equations are typically split
   * into second order (configuration) variables q, and rate (velocity)
   * variables v, where the time derivatives qdot of q are linearly related to
   * v by the kinematic differential equation `qdot = dq/dt = N(q)*v`.
   * Velocity variables are
   * chosen to be physically significant, but configuration variables
   * may be chosen for convenience and do not necessarily have direct physical
   * interpretation. For examples, quaternions are chosen as a numerically
   * stable orientation representation. This is problematic for choosing weights
   * which must be done by physical reasoning
   * as sketched above. We resolve this by introducing
   * the notion of "quasi-coordinates" ꝗ (pronounced "qbar") which are defined
   * by the equation `ꝗdot = dꝗ/dt = v`. Other than time scaling,
   * quasi-coordinates have the same units as their corresponding velocity
   * variables. That is, for weighting we need to think
   * of the configuration coordinates in the same physical space as the velocity
   * variables; weight those by their physical significance; and then map back
   * to an instantaneous weighting
   * on the actual configuration variables q. This mapping is performed
   * automatically; you need only to be concerned about physical weightings.
   *
   * Note that generalized quasi-coordinates `ꝗ` can only be defined locally for
   * a particular configuration `q`. There is in general no meaningful set of
   * `n` generalized
   * coordinates which can be differentiated with respect to time to yield `v`.
   * For example, the Hairy Ball Theorem implies that it is not possible for
   * three orientation variables to represent all 3D rotations without
   * singularities, yet three velocity variables can represent angular velocity
   * in 3D without singularities.
   *
   * To summarize, separate weights can be provided for each of
   * - `n` generalized quasi-coordinates `ꝗ`  (configuration variables in the
   *   velocity variable space), and
   * - `nz` miscellaneous continuous state variables `z`.
   *
   * Weights on the generalized velocity variables `v (= dꝗ/dt)` are derived
   * directly from the weights on `ꝗ`, weighted by a characteristic time. Weights
   * on the actual `nq` generalized coordinates can
   * be calculated efficiently from weights on the quasi-coordinates (details
   * below).
   *
   * <h4>How the weights are used</h4>
   *
   * The errors in the `ꝗ` and `z` variables are weighted by the diagonal elements
   * of diagonal weighting matrices Wꝗ and Wz, respectively. (The block-diagonal
   * weighting matrix `Wq` on the original generalized coordinates `q` is
   * calculated from `N` and `Wꝗ`; see below.) In the absence of
   * other information, the default for all weighting values is one, so `Wꝗ` and
   * `Wz` are `n × n` and `nz × nz` identity matrices. The weighting matrix `Wv`
   * for the velocity variables is just `Wv = τ*Wꝗ` where `τ` is a
   * "characteristic time" for the system, that is, a quantity in time units
   * that represents a significant evolution of the trajectory. This serves to
   * control the accuracy with which velocity is determined relative to
   * configuration. Note that larger values of `τ` are more conservative since
   * they increase the velocity weights. Typically we use `τ=1.0` or `0.1`
   * seconds for human-scale mechanical systems.
   * <!-- TODO(sherm1): provide more guidance for velocity weighting. -->
   *
   * The weighting matrices `Wq`, `Wv`, and `Wz` are used to compute a weighted
   * infinity norm as follows. Although `Wv` and `Wz` are constant, the actual
   * weightings may be state dependent for relative-error calculations.
   * Define block diagonal error weighting matrix `E=diag(Eq,Ev,Ez)` as follows:
   * <pre>
   *   Eq = Wq
   *   Ev: Ev(i,i) = { min(Wv(i,i), 1/|vᵢ|)     if vᵢ is relative
   *                 { Wv(i,i)                  if vᵢ is absolute
   *   Ez: Ez(i,i) = { min(Wz(i,i), 1/|zᵢ|)     if zᵢ is relative
   *                 { Wz(i,i)                  if zᵢ is absolute
   * </pre>
   * (`Ev` and `Ez` are diagonal.) A `v` or `z` will be maintained to relative
   * accuracy unless (a) it is "close" to zero (less than 1), or (b) the
   * variable has been defined as requiring absolute accuracy. Position
   * variables `q` are always maintained to absolute accuracy (see
   * [Sherman 2011] for rationale).
   *
   * Now given an error estimate vector `e=[eq ev ez]`, the vector `f=E*e`
   * can be considered to provide a unitless fractional error for each of the
   * state variables. To achieve a given user-specified accuracy `a`, we require
   * that norm_inf(`f`) <= `a`. That is, no element of `f` can have absolute
   * value larger than `a`. We also use `f` to determine an ideal next step
   * size using an appropriate integrator-specific computation.
   *
   * <h4>Determining weights for q</h4>
   *
   * The kinematic differential equations `qdot=N(q)*v` employ an `nq × n`
   * matrix `N`. By construction, this relationship is invertible using `N`'s
   * left pseudo-inverse `N⁺` so that `v=N⁺ qdot` and `N⁺ N = I` (the identity
   * matrix); however, `N N⁺ != I`, as `N` has more rows than columns generally.
   * [Nikravesh 1988] shows how such a matrix `N` can be determined and provides
   * more information. Given this relationship between `N` and `N⁺`, we can
   * relate weighted errors in configuration coordinates `q` to weighted errors in
   * generalized quasi-coordinates `ꝗ`, as the following derivation shows: <pre>
   *            v = N⁺ qdot         Inverse kinematic differential equation
   *        dꝗ/dt = N⁺ dq/dt        Use synonyms for v and qdot
   *           dꝗ = N⁺ dq           Change time derivatives to differentials
   *        Wꝗ dꝗ = Wꝗ N⁺ dq        Pre-multiply both sides by Wꝗ
   *      N Wꝗ dꝗ = N Wꝗ N⁺ dq      Pre-multiply both sides by N
   *      N Wꝗ dꝗ = Wq dq           Define Wq := N Wꝗ N⁺
   *       N Wꝗ v = Wq qdot         Back to time derivatives.
   * </pre>
   * The last two equations show that `Wq` as defined above provides the
   * expected relationship between the weighted `ꝗ` or `v` variables in velocity
   * space and the weighted `q` or `qdot` (resp.) variables in configuration
   * space.
   *
   * Finally, note that a diagonal entry of one of the weighting matrices can
   * be set to zero to disable error estimation for that state variable
   * (i.e., auxiliary variable or configuration/velocity variable pair), but
   * that setting an entry to a negative value will cause an exception to be
   * thrown when the integrator is initialized.
