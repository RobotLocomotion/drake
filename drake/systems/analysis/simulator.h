/// contact.
///
/// Given a current Context, we expect a System to provide us with
/// - derivatives for the continuous differential equations that already satisfy
/// the differentiated form of the constraints (typically, acceleration
/// constraints),
/// - a projection method for least-squares correction of violated higher-level
/// constraints (position and velocity level),
/// - a time-of-next-update method that can be used to adjust the integrator
/// step size in preparation for a discrete update,
/// - a method that can update discrete variables when their update time is
/// reached,
/// - witness (guard) functions for event isolation,
/// - event handlers (reset functions) for making appropriate changes to state
/// and mode variables when an event has been isolated.
///
/// The continuous parts of the trajectory are advanced using a numerical
