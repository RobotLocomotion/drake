/** A forward dynamics solver for hybrid dynamic systems represented by
 * `System<T>` objects. Starting with an initial Context for a given System,
 * %Simulator advances time and produces a series of Context values that forms a
 * trajectory satisfying the system's dynamic equations to a specified accuracy.
 * Only the Context is modified by a %Simulator; the System is const.
 *
 * A Drake System is a continuous/discrete/hybrid dynamic system where the
 * continuous part is a DAE, that is, it is expected to consist of a set of
 * differential equations and bilateral algebraic constraints. The set of active
 * constraints may change as a result of particular events, such as contact.
 *
 * Given a current Context, we expect a System to provide us with
 * - derivatives for the continuous differential equations that already satisfy
 * the differentiated form of the constraints (typically, acceleration
 * constraints),
 * - a projection method for least-squares correction of violated higher-level
 * constraints (position and velocity level),
 * - a time-of-next-update method that can be used to adjust the integrator
 * step size in preparation for a discrete update,
 * - a method that can update discrete variables when their update time is
 * reached,
 * - witness (guard) functions for event isolation,
 * - event handlers (reset functions) for making appropriate changes to state
 * and mode variables when an event has been isolated.
 *
 * The continuous parts of the trajectory are advanced using a numerical
 * integrator. Different integrators have different properties; if you know
 * about that you can choose the one that is most appropriate for your
 * application. Otherwise, a default is provided which is adequate for most
 * systems.
 *
 * @tparam T The vector element type, which must be a valid Eigen scalar.
 *
 * Instantiated templates for the following kinds of T's are provided and
 * available to link against in libdrakeSystemAnalysis:
 * - double
 * - AutoDiffXd
 *
 * Other instantiations are permitted but take longer to compile.
