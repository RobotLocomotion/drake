/**
 * This is a Drake System 2.0 block that takes a RigidBodyTree and publishes LCM
 * messages that are intended for the Drake Visualizer, but can also be used by
 * other consumers. It does this in two phases: initialization, which runs when
 * `DoPublish()` is called with `Context::get_time()` equal to zero, and
 * run-time, which runs every time `doPublish()` is called.
 *
 * During initialization, this system block analyzes the RigidBodyTree and tells
 * Drake Visualizer what it will be visualizing. For example, these include the
 * number of rigid bodies, their dimensions, and colors. The LCM message used
 * during this phase is called `lcmt_viewer_load_robot` and the channel name is
 * "DRAKE_VIEWER_LOAD_ROBOT".
 *
 * During run-time, this system block takes the current state of the model and
 * tells Drake Visualizer how to visualize the model. For example, this includes
 * the position and orientation of each rigid body. The LCM messages used during
 * this phase is `lcmt_viewer_draw` and the channel name is
 * "DRAKE_VIEWER_DRAW".
