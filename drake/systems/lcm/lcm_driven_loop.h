/**
 * This class implements a loop that's driven by a Lcm message. The context time
 * is explicitly slaved to the time in the received Lcm message. This class is
 * intended to provide a generalized way to implement a message handling loop:
 * an input message arrives, from which a response is computed and published.
 * A common use case is to implement a distributed controller for a physical
 * robot, where low level communication with the hardware is handled in the
 * device driver (a separate process than the controller). The device driver
 * sends a message containing the estimated state. The controller processes
 * that message and sends back a command in response. The device driver finally
 * receives and executes the command.
 *
 * This class is designed to be agnostic to different types of the driving Lcm
 * message to provide a generic API. The Lcm message is internally encapsulated
 * in AbstractValue, which erases its type. In addition, the message time stamp
 * is the only required information by this class, which can be extracted by
 * an instance of LcmMessageToTimeInterface. It is assumed that the caller knows
 * the concrete type of the message, and is able to supply a time converter.
 *
 * This class uses the Simulator class internally for event handling
 * (kPublishAction, kDiscreteUpdateAction, kUnrestrictedUpdateAction) and
 * continuous state integration (e.g. the I term in a PID). The main message
 * handling loop conceptually is:
 * <pre>
 * while(context.time < stop_time) {
 *   msg = wait_for_message("channel");
 *   simulator.StepTo(msg.time);
 *   if (publish) {
 *     system.Publish(simulator.context);
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Since time is slaved to some outside source, the user needs to be mindful of
 * `system`'s configuration especially about event timing. For example, let us
 * assume that `system` is configured to perform a discrete time action every
 * 5ms (at 200Hz), and the necessary computation for `system` to step forward
 * in time is very small. Now, suppose the driving message arrives at 1 Hz in
 * real time. One would observe 200 such actions occur in rapid succession
 * followed by nearly one second of silence. This is because
 * `msg = wait_for_message("channel")` takes about one second in real time,
 * and `simulator.StepTo(msg.time)`, which forwards the simulator's clock by
 * one second and performs 200 actions takes about 0 seconds in real time.
 * The root cause is that the 200Hz rate of the handler system is tied to the
 * internal virtual clock rather than real time. This problem is less
 * significant when the computation time for handling one message is roughly
 * the same as the interval between consecutive driving messages.
 *
 * This implementation relies on several assumptions:
 * 1. The loop is blocked only on one Lcm message.
 * 2. It's pointless to for the handler system to perform any computation
 * without a new Lcm message, thus the handler loop is blocking.
 * 3. The computation for the given system should be faster than the incoming
 * message rate.
