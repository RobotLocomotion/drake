/// A pass through system with input `u` and output `y = u`. This is
/// mathematically equivalent to a Gain system with its gain equal to one.
/// However this system incurs no computational cost.
/// The input to this system directly feeds through to its output.
/// This system is used, for instance, in PidController which is a Diagram
/// composed of simple framework primitives. In this case a PassThrough is used
/// to connect the exported input of the Diagram to the inputs of the Gain
/// systems for the proportioanal and integral constants of the controller. This
/// is necessary to provide an output port to which the internal Gain subsystems
/// connect. In this case the PassThrough is effectively creating an output port
/// that feeds through the input to the Diagram and that can now be connected to
/// the inputs of the inner subsystems to the Diagram.
