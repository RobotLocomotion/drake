/// A simple model of an ideal depth sensor. Example real-world depth sensors
/// include Lidar, IR, sonar, etc. The depth measurements are taken at evenly
/// spaced pitch angles and yaw angles. Ray casting is used to obtain the depth
/// measurements and all pitch / yaw combinations in a single resulting depth
/// image are obtained at a single effective point in time. Thus, this sensor
/// does *not* model aliasing effects due to the time spent scanning vertically
/// and horizontally.
///
/// There are two frames associated with this sensor: its base frame and its
/// optical frame. This sensor's specification and configuration are defined in
/// terms of this sensor's base frame. The base frame's origin defines the point
/// from which this sensor's ray casts originate. Its +X, +Y, and +Z axes are
/// pointing towards this sensor's "forward," "left", and "up" directions,
/// respectively.
///
/// This sensor's optical frame's origin is the same as the base frame's origin.
/// Its +X axis defines where a particular ray cast is pointing. There are two
/// angles associated with a depth measurement, as described below. Both angles
/// are defined in terms of the sensor's base frame. Together they define a
/// transform between the base frame and optical frame.
///
///   1. yaw   - The horizontal scan angle that rotates about this sensor's base
///              frame's +Z axis using the right-hand rule. When the pitch is
///              zero, a yaw of zero results in this sensor measuring down the
///              base frame's +X axis.
///   2. pitch - The vertical scan angle that rotates about this sensor's base
///              frames's -Y axis using using the right-hand rule. In other
///              words, when the pitch increases from zero to PI / 2, this
///              sensor's optical frame is tilted to point upward. When the yaw
///              is zero, a pitch of zero results in this sensor measuring down
///              the base frame's +X axis.
///
/// To summarize, the location from which this sensor's rays emanate is
/// (0, 0, 0) in the base frame. When both the yaw and pitch are zero, this
/// sensor's base and optical frames are identical. The yaw causes the optical
/// frame to rotate about the base frame's +Z axis, while the pitch causes it to
/// rotate about this sensor's -Y axis.
///
/// This system has two output ports. The first contains the sensed values
/// stored in a DepthSensorOutput object. For each pitch, there is a fixed
/// number of yaw values as specified by num_yaw(). Each of these vector
/// of yaw values that share the same pitch are contiguous in the output vector.
/// In other words, here is pseudocode describing this sensor's output vector:
///
/// <pre>
///  for i in 0 to num_pitch():
///    for j in 0 to num_yaw():
///      output_vector[i * num_yaw() + j] ==
///          [depth value when yaw   = min_yaw()   + j * yaw_increment() and
///                            pitch = min_pitch() + i * pitch_increment()]
/// </pre>
///
/// If nothing is detected between min_range and max_range, an invalid value of
/// DepthSensor::kTooFar is provided. Is something is detected but the
/// distance is less than  the sensor's minimum sensing range, a value of
/// DepthSensor::kTooClose is provided.
///
/// Sensing errors can be expressed using a distance value of
/// DepthSensorOutput::GetErrorDistance(), and detected using
/// DepthSensorOutput::IsError() or DepthSensorOutput::IsValid(). It is not
/// expected to occur in this system's output because it models an ideal sensor
/// in which sensing errors do not occur. Sensing errors are expected to be used
/// by non-ideal depth sensors.
///
/// The second output port contains a PoseVector, which is `X_WS`, i.e., the
/// transform from this sensor's frame to the world frame. It is useful for
/// converting this sensor's point cloud into the world frame.
