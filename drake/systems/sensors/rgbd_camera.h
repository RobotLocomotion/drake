/// An RGB-D camera system that provides RGB, depth and label images using
/// visual elements of RigidBodyTree.
/// RgbdCamera uses [VTK](https://github.com/Kitware/VTK) as the rendering
/// backend.
/// Its image resolution is fixed at VGA (640 x 480 pixels) for all three
/// images. The depth sensing range is 0.5 m to 5.0 m.
///
/// Let `W` be the world coordinate system. In addition to `W`, there are three
/// more coordinate systems that are associated with an RgbdCamera. They are
/// defined as follows:
///
///   * `B` - The camera's base coordinate system: X-forward, Y-left, and Z-up.
///
///   * `C` - the camera's color sensor's optical coordinate system: `X-right`,
///           `Y-down` and `Z-forward`.
///
///   * `D` - the camera's depth sensor's optical coordinate system: `X-right`,
///           `Y-down` and `Z-forward`.
///
/// The origins of `C` and `D` (i.e., `Co` and `Do`, respectively) are offset
/// from `B`'s origin (`Bo`) by 0 m in `B`'s X-axis, +0.02 m in `B`'s Y-axis,
/// and 0 m in `B`'s Z axis.  Since `C` and `D` are coincident, the depth image
/// is a "registered depth image" for the RGB image. No disparity between the
/// RGB and depth images are modeled. For more details about the poses of `C`
/// and `D`, see the class documentation of CameraInfo.
///
/// Output image format:
///   - The RGB image has four channels in the following order: red, green
///     blue, alpha. Each channel is represented by a uint8_t.
///
///   - The depth image has a depth channel represented by a float. The value
///     stored in the depth channel holds *the Z value in `D`.*  Note that this
///     is different from the range data used by laser range finders (like that
///     provided by DepthSensor) in which the depth value represents the
///     distance from the sensor origin to the object's surface.
///
///   - The label image has single channel represented by a int16_t. The value
///     stored in the channel holds a model ID which corresponds to an object
///     in the scene. For the pixels corresponding to no body, namely the sky
///     and the flat terrain, we assign Label::kNoBody and Label::kFlatTerrain,
///     respectively.
