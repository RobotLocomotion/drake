# Implements a flat but curved lane. The lane is 4 m wide with 2 m shoulders. It
# starts at the world origin with its +s axis coincident with the world's +X
# axis. It immediately curves to the left (+Y direction) by 90 degrees with a
# turning radius of 10 m.
#
# Distances are meters; angles are degrees.
#
# The lane parameters must not change due to hard-coded assumptions about their
# values in `maliput_railcar_test.cc`. The unit test, for example, has a hard
# coded constant named `kCurvedRoadRadius` that must match the arc length. In
# addition, there are assumptions that the lane turns 90 degrees and has a
# certain width and shoulder width.
