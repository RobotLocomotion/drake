# Description

Crossroad is an implementation of Maliput's API that allows users to instantiate
a multilane crossroad.  All lanes in the crossroad are straight, parallel, and in
the same segment. The ends of each lane are connected together via a "magical
loop" that results in vehicles traveling on the Dragway's lanes instantaneously
teleporting from one end of the lane to the opposite end of the lane.

The number of lanes and their lengths, widths, and shoulder widths are all user
specifiable.
