/// MOBIL (Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane Changes) [1] is a planner
/// that minimizes braking requirement for the ego car while also minimizing
/// (per a weighting factor) the braking requirements of any trailing cars
/// within the ego car's immediate neighborhood.  The weighting factor
/// encapsulates the politeness of the ego car to the surrounding traffic.
/// Neighboring cars are defined as those cars immediately ahead and behind the
/// ego, in the current lane and any adjacent lanes; these are determined from
/// the PoseSelector logic applied to a multi-lane Maliput road.
///
/// The induced braking by the ego car and the car following immediately behind
/// it is compared with the induced braking by the ego and its new follower if
/// the ego were to move to any of the neighboring lanes.  The choice that
/// minimizes the induced braking - alternatively maximizes the ego car's
/// "incentive" (the weighted sum of accelerations that the ego car and its
/// neighbors gain by changing lanes) - is chosen as the new lane request.  The
/// request is expressed as a LaneDirection, that references a valid lane in the
/// provided RoadGeometry and the direction of travel.
///
/// Assumptions:
///   1) The planner supports only symmetric lane change rules, without giving
///      preference to lanes to the left or right.
///   2) The planner assumes all traffic behaves according to the Intelligent
///      Driver Model (IDM).
///   3) All neighboring lanes are confluent (i.e. with_s points in the same
///      direction).
///
/// Instantiated templates for the following kinds of T's are provided:
/// - double
///
/// They are already available to link against in the containing library.
///
/// Input Port 0: A PoseVector for the ego car.
///   (InputPortDescriptor getter: ego_pose_input())
///
/// Input Port 1: A FrameVelocity for the ego car.
///   (InputPortDescriptor getter: ego_velocity_input())
///
/// Input Port 2: A BasicVector containing the ego car's commanded acceleration
///   value intercepted from the vehicle's controller (e.g. IdmController).
///   (InputPortDescriptor getter: ego_acceleration_input())
///
/// Input Port 3: A PoseBundle for the traffic cars, possibly including the ego
///   car's pose.
///   (InputPortDescriptor getter: traffic_input())
///
/// Output Port 0: A LaneDirection containing a lane that the ego vehicle must
///   move into and the direction of travel with respect to the lane's canonical
///   direction of travel.  LaneDirection must be consistent with the provided
///   road.
///   (OutputPort getter: lane_output())
