*************************
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty)
*************************

The following instructions are written for the officially supported version of
Ubuntu:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty)

Some hints are given for newer versions of Ubuntu, but details may vary.

Install Prerequisites
=====================

C++ Compiler
------------

A compiler supporting C++14 or higher is required. The installation process
differs depending on which version of Ubuntu is being used.

Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily) and higher the system compiler is sufficient::

    sudo apt-get install g++-multilib

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty) GCC 4.9 or higher must be installed, e.g.::

    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install g++-4.9-multilib gfortran-4.9

Or, Clang 3.7::

    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends lsb-core software-properties-common wget
    wget -q -O - http://llvm.org/apt/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo add-apt-repository -y "deb http://llvm.org/apt/trusty/ llvm-toolchain-trusty-3.7 main"
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install clang-3.7

.. _cmake:

CMake
-----

CMake 3.5 or higher is required. The installation process differs depending on
which version of Ubuntu is being used.

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) and higher the following system package can be
used::

    sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-curses-gui

.. _cmake_on_older_ubuntu_versions:

Older Versions of Ubuntu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On older Ubuntu versions please visit the `CMake Download Page`_ to obtain
the CMake 3.5 pre-compiled binaries.  Extract the archive and add its ``bin``
directory to the ``PATH`` environment variable. For example, below is a
suggested sequence of commands that installs CMake 3.5 into `~/tools/` and then
modifies `~/.bashrc` with the new ``PATH`` environment variable::

    mkdir -p ~/tools
    cd ~/tools
    wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.5/cmake-3.5.2-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    tar zxvf cmake-3.5.2-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    rm cmake-3.5.2-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
    cd cmake-3.5.2-Linux-x86_64/bin
    echo "export PATH=`pwd`:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc

.. _`CMake Download Page`: https://cmake.org/download/

Other Prerequisites
-------------------

Other prerequisites may be installed as follows::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends autoconf automake bison \
      default-jdk doxygen flex freeglut3-dev git \
      graphviz libgtk2.0-dev libhtml-form-perl libjpeg-dev libmpfr-dev \
      libwww-perl libpng-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev libqwt-dev \
      libterm-readkey-perl libtool libvtk-java libvtk5-dev libvtk5-qt4-dev \
      make mpich ninja-build perl pkg-config python-bs4 python-dev \
      python-gtk2 python-html5lib python-numpy python-pip python-sphinx \
      python-vtk subversion swig unzip valgrind
    sudo pip install -U cpplint

Environment
-----------

There are up to two important environment variables to set depending on which
version of Ubuntu is being used.

Compiler Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the system's default compiler is not being used (for example if
gcc/g++/gfortran 4.9 are being used on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), the desired compiler
must be manually specified. One way to do this is to set the ``CC``, ``CXX``,
``FC``, and ``F77`` environment variables. This can be done by executing the command
below. To avoid needing to run this command each time a new terminal is opened,
the command below can also be added to the ``~/.bashrc`` file::

    export CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 FC=gfortran-4.9 F77=gfortran-4.9

Alternatively, every call to ``make`` or ``cmake`` can be preceded with
environment variable settings that specify the correct compiler. For example::

    env CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 FC=gfortran-4.9 F77=gfortran-4.9 make ...

The above examples result in the use of ``gcc`` as the compiler. If you want to
use ``clang`` as the compiler, place the following in your ``~/.bashrc`` file::

    export CC=clang-3.7 CXX=clang++-3.7 FC=gfortran-4.9 F77=gfortran-4.9

Or precede every call to ``make`` or ``cmake`` with compiler specifications.
For example::

    env CC=clang-3.7 CXX=clang++-3.7 FC=gfortran-4.9 F77=gfortran-4.9 make ...

CMake Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note that this environment variable has already been set if
the* :ref:`CMake instructions <cmake_on_older_ubuntu_versions>` *above were followed.*

If the system-installed version of `CMake`_ is not being used, ensure that the
location of the version to be used occurs first in the ``PATH`` environment
variable::

    export PATH=/path/to/cmake-binary/bin:$PATH

For more information, see :ref:`these instructions <cmake_on_older_ubuntu_versions>`.

MATLAB
======

The version of the standard C++ libraries that are shipped with the Linux distribution of MATLAB is severely outdated and can cause problems when running mex files that are built against a newer version of the standard.  The typical error message in this case reports "Invalid MEX-Files"

To work around this issue, the symbolic link for the standard C++ library provided by MATLAB must be redirected to point to a more up-to-date version.

Update the symbolic link in MATLAB to point to the version that was installed earlier into ``/usr/lib``.  An example for MATLAB R2016a is shown below::

    cd /usr/local/MATLAB/R2016a/sys/os/glnxa64
    sudo rm libstdc++.so.6
    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.9/libstdc++.so libstdc++.so.6

Return to Generic Instructions
==============================

When these platform-specific steps are completed,
return to :doc:`from_source` to complete and test the installation.

Note that, from now on, when running Drake commands (including the
ones in the linked instructions, such as ``make`` or ``make test``),
proper `Environment`_ must always be established.
