*****************************************
Avoid Accidental Pushes to the Repository
*****************************************

The Issue
=========

We want to prevent developers from accidentally pushing changes into RobotLocomotion/drake. This is accomplished by:

   1. Everybody agreeing in a naming convention for the respositories.
   2. Providing a dummy url for the repository we want to protect.


A Convention
============

To make the notion of ``origin`` consistent with the idea of the one repository you work with, we agree in the following convention::

   "upstream"  = RobotLocomotion/drake
   "origin" = my fork

so that a simple ``git push`` will push changes into a developer's fork. This still does not prevent you from pushing into ``upstream``. To protect developers from making this simple mistake the following solution is proposed.

A Solution
==========
A way to avoid pushing into a repository is providing a dummy url address to the repository. This is accomplished by issuing the git command::

     git remote set-url --push upstream no_push

where ``no_push`` is the dummy url and ``upstream`` points to RobotLocomotion/drake (recall the convention is to call your fork ``origin``).

If a push to the master repository is attempted issuing a ``git push upstream my_branch``, git will return the following error message::

   fatal: 'no_push' does not appear to be a git repository
   fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
   
   Please make sure you have the correct access rights
   and the repository exists.
