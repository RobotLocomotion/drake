If you're adventurous, things can get better if you make the following changes.

To SeDuMi:

*****

Another interesting note is that there is a typo in the current version of SeDuMi. On line 21 of getada.m, the code reads

if spars(DAt.q > 0.2)

whereas it should read

if spars(DAt.q) > 0.2

This can actually kill your runtime as sparse(DAt.q > 0.2) will almost always evaluate to true (unless all entries of DAt.q are less than 0.2), meaning that SeDuMi is not exploiting the potential sparsity of DAt.q.
