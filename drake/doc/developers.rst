Introduction
============

If you have improvements to Drake, send us your pull requests!

Our standard workflow is to fork `Drake's official Github repository
<https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/>`_ into your
own Github account and then push your changes into a branch on your fork. Once
you believe your code is ready to be merged into Drake's primary repository,
open a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/>`_
via the Github website. Your code will then undergo an interactive review
process and :ref:`Continuous Integration (CI) <continuous_integration_notes>`
tests before it is merged into
`Drake's primary repository <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake>`_.

Drake's :ref:`CI service <continuous_integration_notes>` runs on all pull requests each time they are
submitted and updated. Pull requests cannot be merged into master unless all
unit tests pass on all
:ref:`supported platform configurations <supported-configurations>`.

Drake's CI server also runs continuously on
`Drake's primary master branch <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake>`_
using an even more comprehensive set of unit tests.
If problems are detected on this branch, the build cop will
:ref:`revert the PRs that most likely caused the problem <build_cop>`.
To increase the likelihood that your pull requests pass CI tests and are not
reverted, you can run the unit tests locally. Instructions for how to do that
are provided :ref:`here <unit-test-instructions>`. Note, however, that there are
many computationally-demanding tests and running the entire test suite can take
several hours depending on your machine.

We would like to hear about your success stories if you've used Drake in your
own projects.  Please consider contributing to our :doc:`gallery` by editing
``drake/doc/gallery.rst`` and submitting a pull request with the update!

Supported Configurations
========================

The following table shows the configurations and platforms that Drake
officially supports. Supported configurations are tested in continuous
integration. All other configurations are provided on a best-effort basis.

For CMake builds, the "Unix Makefiles" and "Ninja" CMake generators are
supported.

For CMake builds, the supported version of MATLAB is R2015b.

For CMake builds,
minimal configuration is defined as the minimal required externals
from the superbuild. This is configured by turning off all externals using
``ccmake`` or ``cmake-gui`` except for ``WITH_EIGEN``, ``WITH_GOOGLETEST``,
and  ``WITH_GFLAGS``, which should be set to ``ON``.

Almost all of Drake and Drake's externals are
supported on Bazel. "Superbuild Deps" are not meaningful in the context
of Bazel, since there is no configurable superbuild. MATLAB is not supported on
Bazel, and there are no plans to add support.

Code Review
===========

Review Process
--------------

For complex changes, especially those that will span multiple PRs, please
open a GitHub issue and solicit design feedback before you invest a lot of
time in code.

Before your submit a pull request, please consult the
:ref:`Code Review Checklist <code-review-checklist>`,
where a list of the most frequent problems are collected.

Be prepared to engage in active code review on your pull requests.  The Drake
code review process has two phases: feature review and platform review. You
are responsible for finding reviewers, and for providing them the information
they need to review your change effectively. If a reviewer asks you for more
information, that is a sign you should add more documentation to your PR.

A PR generally *should not* include more than 750 added or changed lines (the
green ``+###`` number as reported by github), and *must not* include more than
1500 lines, with the following exemptions:

  - Data files do not count towards the line limit.

  - Machine-generated changes do not count towards the line limit.

  - Files in
    :ref:`Special Directories <directory_structure_special_directories>`
    do not count towards the line limit.

  - This rule may be overridden by agreement of at least two platform reviewers
    (listed below).

The utility ``drake/tools/prstat`` will report the total added or changed
lines, excluding files that are easily identified to meet the exemptions above.

We use https://reviewable.io for code reviews. You can sign in for free with
your GitHub identity. Before your first code review, please take a look at
:doc:`reviewable`.

**Feature Review.** After creating your pull request, assign it to someone
else on your team for feature review. Choose the person most familiar
with the context of your pull request. This reviewer is responsible for
protecting your team by inspecting for bugs, for test coverage, and for
alignment with the team's goals. During this review, you and your reviewer
should also strive to minimize the number of changes that will be necessary
in platform review.

**Platform Review.** After your feature reviewer has signed off on your change,
reassign it to a Drake owner for platform review. The owner will inspect for
architectural compatibility, stability, performance, test coverage, and style.

The following GitHub users are Drake owners. If possible, seek platform review
from an owner who has previously reviewed related changes. Shared context will
make the review faster.

- @ggould-tri (Toyota Research Institute)
- @jwnimmer-tri (Toyota Research Institute)
- @psiorx (MIT)
- @sammy-tri (Toyota Research Institute)
- @sherm1 (Toyota Research Institute)
- @soonho-tri (Toyota Research Institute)
- @RussTedrake (MIT / Toyota Research Institute)

**Merge.** If you have write access to RobotLocomotion/drake, a green
"Merge Pull Request" button will appear when your change is fully reviewed and
passes CI. You may click it to merge your PR. If you do not have write access,
or if you believe that status checks are failing for inconsequential reasons,
ask your platform reviewer to perform the merge for you.

**After Merge.** If your PR breaks continuous integration, the :doc:`buildcop`
will contact you to work out a resolution.
