*****************************************
Source installation (mac, linux, windows)
*****************************************

Optional: Setting up the MATLAB Compiler
========================================

If you'd like to build the MATLAB interface, you will need a `C/C++ compiler that is compatible with your MATLAB version <http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/>`_.  Run ``mex -setup`` at the MATLAB command line to set this up.  We typically use gcc on linux, clang on mac, or Visual Studio 2015 on Windows.

Make sure that the MATLAB executable is in your path.  (e.g., typing ``matlab`` at the system command line should start an instance of MATLAB).  For example, on Mac you might consider ``sudo ln -s /Applications/MATLAB_R2014a.app/bin/matlab /usr/bin/matlab``, or you can actually add the MATLAB/bin directory to your system path.  On windows, you should `edit your path environment variable <http://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml>`_ to include e.g. ``C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2014a\bin``.


Getting Drake
=============

Drake is compliant with the `PODs <http://sourceforge.net/p/pods/home/Home/>`_ software development guidelines.  For convenience, we have created pods or wrapper pods for most of the prerequisites, externals, and solvers that you might want to use with Drake.  Some of these will require you to have access to the software licenses.

Note: If you are using Windows, you will want to make sure that ``git`` is set to `handle cross-platform linefeed issues <https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration#idp31554304>`_.  These options appear to be enabled by default in the cygwin installation of ``git``, but must be set manually on the native windows version.

We recommend that you `setup SSH access to Github.com <https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/>`_
to avoid needing to type your password each time you access it. The following
instructions assume you have uploaded your public SSH key to your Github
account.

Now run::

    git clone git@github.com:RobotLocomotion/drake.git drake-distro


Note: the build process may encounter problems if you have unusual characters
like parentheses in the absolute path to the drake-distro directory
(see `#394 <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/394>`_).

The above ``git clone`` command will configure Drake's primary repository as a
remote called ``origin``. We recommend that you configure your fork of Drake's
primary repository as the ``origin`` remote and Drake's primary repository as
the ``upstream`` remote. This can be done by executing the following commands::

    cd drake-distro
    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:[your github user name]/drake.git
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:RobotLocomotion/drake.git
    git remote set-url --push upstream no_push


If you want to use the private externals
========================================

Drake includes support for some externals which we are not able to redistribute directly
(SNOPT, SEDUMI, BERTINI, ...).  In order to have drake locally install these for you, you must have access to the corresponding private github repositories, and must set your machine up with SSH keys.

Follow the instructions here:
https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

This capability is primarily meant for members of our team and close collaborators with whom we share licenses.

Using Gurobi as an external
===========================

Gurobi is enabled to build by default if one uses ``WITH_ALL_SUPPORTED_EXTERNALS``. Additionally, some users may wish to install the Gurobi Optimizer as part of their Drake build even if they do not select ``WITH_ALL_SUPPORTED_EXTERNALS`` by toggling ``WITH_GUROBI`` to ``ON``.

To facilitate the Gurobi's building process, create an account and obtain a license on `Gurobi's website <http://www.gurobi.com/registration/general-reg-form?utm_expid=11945996-32.QTGUWGdTRw2vsRW5839Z5w.1&utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gurobi.com%2Flogin>`_ *before* perforiming the Drake build with Gurobi. To actually be able to use Gurobi, there are two required verification steps:

1. During the Drake build process, Gurobi will ask for your credentials that you created on their site in the above step. If you are doing a parallel build (with ``-j``), you may see that your build has paused at a seemingly random spot. If so, hit enter, and you should see something like::

     Enter your password for gurobi.com:

   If so, press enter again and it should prompt you for your username. Enter that, hit enter, and enter your password. At this point, the Drake build should continue to completion.

2. Before doing anything else, you need to ensure that your Gurobi license is verified. To do this, simply run::

     cd drake-distro
     ./externals/gurobi/gurobi604/linux64/bin/grbgetkey [key-number]

where ``[key-number]`` is the number you were given when you obtained a license from Gurobi. You should now have a functioning Gurobi to use with Drake.

Mandatory platform specific instructions
========================================

Before running build, you will need to follow the instructions for your host system:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    fedora
    homebrew
    ubuntu
    windows

Build the collection
====================
There are three ways to build Drake:

1. :ref:`Using Make <build_with_make>`
2. :ref:`Using Ninja <build_with_ninja>`
3. :ref:`Using ROS Catkin <build_with_ros_catkin>`

For instructions on how to switch build systems, see
:ref:`this subsection <identifying_build_system_used>`.

Make support is more mature, but Ninja is faster, more modern, and will
receive more investment from the Drake development team going forward.
However, the following features are known not to work in Ninja yet:

* Gurobi

.. _build_with_make:

Build with Make
---------------
First, confirm that `Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ is installed
on your system by executing::

    make --version

To build with ``Make``, execute::

    cd drake-distro
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make

**Do NOT use sudo.** Just ``make`` is sufficient, and will prevent problems
later. Feel free to use ``make -j`` if your platform supports it. Note that the
above ``cmake`` command does not specify a build type, so drake will be built
with ``Release`` by default. If you wish to build with a different build type,
change the cmake command to ``cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug``
to build with build type "Debug". Alternative build modes include
"RelWithDebInfo" and "Release". They differ in terms of the amount of debug
symbols included in the resulting binaries and how efficiently the code
executes.

In addition to the build mode, Drake has many other build options. You can view
them in ``drake-distro/CMakeLists.txt``. The build options typically start with
"WITH\_". The options can be included in the above ``cmake`` command by adding
additional ``-D`` flags. You can also specify them using a text-based GUI by
executing::

    cd drake-distro/build
    ccmake ../

To get details about the actual compiler and linker commands, execute::

    cd drake-distro/build
    make VERBOSE=true

.. _build_with_ninja:

Build with Ninja
----------------
First, confirm that `Ninja <https://ninja-build.org/>`_ is installed
on your system::

    ninja --version

Drake uses `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_ to generate Ninja files within an
out-of-source build directory. You can configure CMake options by passing
them at the ``cmake`` command line with ``-D``, or in a GUI by running
``ccmake`` instead of ``cmake``. For instance, the following sequence of
commands generates Ninja files with build type ``Debug``, and then runs the
Ninja build.

::

    cd drake-distro
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../ -G Ninja
    ninja

Ninja can rebuild Drake from within ``drake-distro/build/drake/`` without
rebuilding the entire super-build.  It can also build specific targets.
Tab-completion is supported.

::

    cd drake-distro/build/drake
    ninja

To review the raw shell commands, compiler flags, and linker flags that CMake
generated, consult ``build.ninja`` and ``drake/build.ninja``, or run
``ninja -v`` for a verbose build.

.. _build_with_ros_catkin:

Build with ROS Catkin
---------------------

See:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    from_source_ros

.. _build_and_install_directories:

Locations of Build and Install Directories
==========================================

This section contains information about where Drake's build artifacts are
located. They assume you are following the official from-source build
instructions given above. The locations will differ if you're building Drake
using an alternative method, e.g., completely out of source.

Builds based on `Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ and
`Ninja <https://ninja-build.org/>`_ place build artifacts in
``drake-distro/build/``. Externally visible build artifacts are placed in
``drake-distro/build/install``.

Builds using ROS Catkin place build artifacts in Catkin's
`development space <http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Development_.28Devel.29_Space>`_
and place externally-visible build artifacts in Catkin's
`install space <http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces#Install_Space>`_. When
following the
:ref:`official Drake/ROS installation instructions <build_from_source_using_ros_catkin>`,
these spaces are typically ``drake_catkin_workspace/devel`` and
``drake_catkin_workspace/install``, respectively.

.. _identifying_build_system_used:

Identifying Which Build System Is Used and Switching Build Systems
==================================================================

If you encounter an existing from-source installation of Drake and aren't sure
whether it was built using ``Make`` or ``Ninja``, [1]_ look
in ``drake-distro/build``. If there is a file called ``Makefile``, Drake was
built using ``Make``. If there is a file called ``rules.ninja``, Drake was built
using ``Ninja``. To switch the build system, first save and commit all of your
work. Then delete all build artifacts::

    $ cd drake-distro
    $ rm -rf build
    $ rm -rf externals
    $ git clean -fdx
    $ git reset --hard HEAD

Once you've deleted all build artifacts, follow the instructions above for your
desired build system.

.. [1] ROS Catkin is not listed since you should immediately know if Drake was :ref:`compiled using ROS Catkin <build_from_source_using_ros_catkin>` based on whether it is located in a ROS workspace. Once compiled using Catkin, do not attempt to switch build systems.

.. _test_from_source_installation:

Test Your Installation
======================

Start MATLAB, then at the MATLAB prompt do::

    cd drake-distro/drake
    addpath_drake

Then ``cd`` into the examples directories and try some things out.  Here are a few
fun ones to get you started:

* ``runLQR`` in the ``examples/CartPole`` directory
* ``runLQR`` in the ``examples/Quadrotor2D`` directory
* ``RimlessWheelPlant.run()`` in the ``examples/RimlessWheel`` directory
* ``StateMachineControl.run()`` in the ``examples/PlanarMonopodHopper`` directory

To run some unit tests, execute the following::

    cd drake-distro/build/drake
    ctest -VV

For more details on how to run Drake's unit tests, see the instructions
here: :ref:`unit-test-instructions`.

If you have problems, please check the :doc:`faq`.  If the solution is not
there, or if you discover something missing from our installation instructions
or lists of prerequisites, then please
`file an issue <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/new>`_ and label
it as *installation*.
