In order to fork a copy (branch) of robotlib, e.g. for development,  you probably want to be careful to unset the property which emails the entire locomotion group on every commit.  Use the following commands:

svn cp https://svn.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/robotlib/trunk https://svn.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/robotlib/branches/mydev
cd into your existing robotlib checkout
svn switch https://svn.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/robotlib/branches/mydev
svn propdel -R rlg:email mydev 
svn commit -m "removing email broadcast property"

where "mydev" can be replaced with whatever you'd like to call your local copy.
