******************************
Important Note (October, 2016)
******************************


Drake is currently undergoing a major renovation, with all of the core
libraries moving into C++.  The examples will move and the existing APIs will
change.  During this time, we recommend that users either engage deeply
(contributing examples/tests which provide coverage of your use cases) or wait
for a few months until the APIs have stabilized.  For a stable release, consider
checking out `this SHA <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/last_sha_with_windows_support>`_.

This change is fantastically exciting -- Drake is becoming a mature and powerful
tool.  Thank you for your patience.


********
Overview
********

Drake ("dragon" in Middle English) is a C++ toolbox started by the
`Robot Locomotion Group <http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/>`_ at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL).  The :doc:`development team has now
grown significantly </credits>`, with core development led by the `Toyota Research Institute`_.
It is a collection of tools for analyzing the dynamics of our robots and building control systems for them, with a heavy emphasis on optimization-based design/analysis.

While there are an increasing number of simulation tools available for robotics, most of them function like a black box: commands go in, sensors come out.  Drake aims to simulate even very complex dynamics of robots (e.g. including friction, contact, aerodynamics, ...), but always with an emphasis on exposing the structure in the governing equations (sparsity, analytical gradients, polynomial structure, uncertainty quantification, ...) and making this information available for advanced planning, control, and analysis algorithms.  Drake provides interfaces to high-level languages (MATLAB, Python, ...) to enable rapid-prototyping of new algorithms, and also aims to provide solid open-source implementations for many state-of-the-art algorithms.  Finally, we hope Drake provides many compelling examples that can help people get started and provide much needed benchmarks.   We are excited to accept user contributions to improve the coverage.

Here is a quick summary of capabilities:

* Modeling Dynamical Systems
	* C++ `block-diagram <http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1systems_1_1_diagram_builder.html#details>`_  modeling environment with support for continuous, discrete, hybrid, event-triggered, and multi-rate systems
	* `Rigid-body kinematics and dynamics <http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__rigid__body__systems.html>`_
		* Rigorously designed and tested, well-documented `multi-body library <http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__concepts.html>`_
		* Load from :doc:`SDF / URDF models <models>` (+ a few custom tags)
		* `Contact/collisions modeled with compliant contact <http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__drake__contacts.html>`_ ; **Coming soon**: time-stepping and hybrid models for rigid contact
		* Geometry queries (e.g. collision detection, contact queries, and sensor queries) for simple geometries and convex meshes;  **Coming soon**: non-convex meshes and multi-contact
		* `Rich library of kinematic and dynamic queries <http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/class_rigid_body_tree.html>`_ (e.g. Centroidal dynamics, Center of Pressure, Kinematic Jacobians, ...)
	* `Sensor models <http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__sensor__systems.html>`_ (lidar, RGB-D camera, imu, contact force/torque)
	* Hand-derived models for many canonical control dynamical systems
	* `Easily add your own models/components <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/drake/examples/simple_continuous_time_system.cc>`_
	* For nearly all of the above we aim to expose sparsity in the governing equations and provide analytical gradients / symbolic analysis

		* `Stochastic systems <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/6374>`_ (Random source blocks already exist, but need random contexts and symbolic support).
		* More sophisticated rendering (towards photo-realism) and noise models for perception
* Core Libraries / Utilities
	* `MathematicalProgram <http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html>`_, a C++ interface wrapping many open-source and commercial solvers

	* Local stability/controllability/observability analysis (via linearization / semi-definite programming)
	* **To be ported from MATLAB to C++**:
		* Find fixed points / trim conditions
		* Region of attraction analysis using sums-of-squares optimization
		* Finite-time verification (e.g. forward/backward reachability analysis)
	* **Coming soon**:
