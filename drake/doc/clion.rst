CLion IDE setup
***************

This guide describes how to set up Drake in the JetBrains CLion IDE.
It is assumed that ``drake-distro`` is
:ref:`already installed <installation_and_quick_start>`.

Using CLion with CMake
======================

(We recommend using Bazel rather than CMake; see instructions below.
**CAUTION**: the Bazel plugin does not necessarily work with the latest
CLion. We have tested it up to CLion 2016.3.5 and it does not
currently work with CLion 2017.1.)

Installing CLion
----------------

1. Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/. Download the latest version
   of CLion. For OSX, choose the version with bundled custom JDK.
2. Install CLion. Exact steps depend on your platform, but it's
   straightforward. Just using defaults for everything is fine. You now have a
   30-day trial version of CLion. Either try it out as is, or get a free
   academic license `here <https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students>`_.

Setting up Drake in CLion
-------------------------

We'll set up CLion to build Drake only. The dependencies will just be built
from the command line. It is assumed Drake was cloned into a ``drake-distro``
directory as described in the :ref:`installation instructions <getting_drake>`.

1. :ref:`Build Drake <build_the_collection>` from the command line.
2. In the Welcome to CLion screen, click ``Import Project from Sources``. Or
   from the menu ``File > Import Project...``
3. Browse and select ``drake-distro/drake`` and click OK.
4. When asked whether to overwrite the existing ``CMakeLists.txt``, just click
   ``Open Project``.
5. Go to CLion Preferences (on OSX, ``CLion-EAP > Preferences``, on Ubuntu,
   ``File > Settings...``). Note that this preferences window comprises both
   global settings and project-specific settings (as noted by the text 'for
   current project' on some of the preference pages).
6. Browse to ``Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake``.
7. Under ``CMake Options``, fill in
   ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/absolute_path_to_your/drake-distro/build/install``.
8. [This step only for Ubuntu 14.04 - Trusty]. Under ``CMake Options``
   expand the tab ``Pass system
   environment``. Add the following environment variables.  (You can copy these
   from this documentation one at a time and click on the ``paste`` button at
   the right of the environment variables dialog.)

   * ``CC=gcc-4.9``
   * ``CXX=g++-4.9``
   * ``FC=gfortran-4.9``

9. Click OK. CLion will take about a minute to reload the CMake Project. If
   everything is in order, there should be no errors or warnings. For fun,
   check out the `cache pane
   <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/cmake-cache.html>`_ in the
   `CMake tool window
   <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2016.1/cmake.html>`_ (the CMake icon
   in the lower left corner of the workspace); it's pretty handy.
10. If CLion asks you about unregistered VCS roots, you can just add them.

Building
--------

To build Drake (and only Drake, this assumes that dependencies were already
built!):

1. Go to Run > Edit Configurations.
2. Select 'Build All' and click OK.
3. Click Run > Build (or use the keyboard shortcut).

Note that it's possible to select any CMake target you want from the Edit
Configurations menu. This can come in very handy when you want to quickly
iterate on a e.g. a specific executable without building all of Drake all the
time.

Running a C++ executable
------------------------
1. Go to Run > Run...
2. Click an executable, or start typing to find your favorite executable and hit enter.

Debugging .mex functions in OSX
-------------------------------

1. Go to Run > Edit Configurations
2. Click the + in the top left corner to create a new Run/Debug Configuration.
3. Name it Matlab
4. Use All targets as the Target
5. For Executable, click on the drop-down menu, scroll all the way down and
   click Select Other...
6. Browse to your Matlab executable. For OSX you can just use
   Applications/MATLAB_R2014a.app or something similar.
7. As the working directory, use ``drake-distro/drake``.
8. Under Environment Variables, add a variable GRB_LICENSE_FILE and set it to
   the absolute path of your Gurobi license file. If you don't do this, Gurobi
   will not be able to find the license file since Gurobi relies on either the
   GRB_LICENSE_FILE or the HOME environment variable (if the license file is in
   the default location) to find it.
9. Leave everything else as is. Click OK to save the Run/Debug Configuration.
10. Click Run > Debug Matlab.
11. Once CLion is done building and you're in the Debug pane, click the
    Debugger tab and then the LLDB subtab.
12. Enter the following: ``process handle -p true -n false -s false SIGSEGV
    SIGBUS`` (taken from
    http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/debugging-on-mac-platforms.html)
    and hit enter.
13. Click Resume Program (play button) twice. Matlab should start up. Once it's
    started, you can run whatever Matlab code you like. You can set breakpoints
    in the C++ code in CLion, and if that code is called from Matlab and the
    breakpoint is hit, you'll be able to step through in CLion and inspect
    variables.

Note: if Matlab asks for activation, you'll need to copy the license (.lic)
file from ~/.matlab/R2014b_licenses (or whatever version of Matlab you have) to
the licenses subfolder of your Matlab installation
(e.g. /Applications/MATLAB_R2014b.app/licenses). If the licenses subfolder does
not exist, create it.

Using CLion with Bazel
======================

(See note above about CLion versions compatible with Bazel.)

First, install Bazel and build Drake with Bazel, following
:ref:`the Drake Bazel instructions <bazel>`.

A Note About Environment Variables
----------------------------------
CLion forwards environment variables to the processes it launches, including
the Bazel client and server. We have a number of Bazel repository rules that
consult environment variables, especially ``PATH``, to locate external
dependencies. Therefore, some care is necessary to make sure CLion is launched
with the environment you actually want!

**Ubuntu users** will generally get good behavior by default, because ``apt``
installs binaries in reasonable, standard paths, and because most CLion launch
mechanisms will have already sourced the ``.bashrc``. Do be careful that
``ccache`` is not on your ``PATH``, though.  If you launch CLion with ``ccache``
on your ``PATH``, and then CLion launches a Bazel server, you'll need to quit
CLion, kill the Bazel server, and run ``bazel clean`` to recover.

**OS X users** will get broken behavior by default.  When you run an OS X app
graphically, the parent process is `launchd` (PID 1), which provides its own
standard environment variables to the child process.  In particular, it provides
a minimal ``PATH`` that does not include ``/usr/local/bin``, where most Homebrew
executables are installed.  Consequently, the Bazel build will fail to find
Homebrew dependencies like ``glib``, ``pkg-config``, and ``gfortran``.

The simplest solution is not to launch CLion graphically. Instead, configure
your shell environment properly in ``.bashrc``, and launch CLion from the
command line::

  /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/MacOS/clion

If you strongly prefer clicking on buttons, you might be able to configure the
``launchd`` environment using ``launchctl``, but this process is finicky. We
have no reliable recipe for it yet.

Installing the Bazel Plugin
---------------------------

To use Bazel in CLion, you must install a plugin supplied by Google. The plugin
requires CLion 2016.3 or later.  To install the plugin, open
``File > Settings``, select ``Plugins``, and press the ``Browse repositories``
button.  Locate and install the ``CLion with Bazel`` plugin. You will be
prompted to restart CLion.

Setting up Drake in CLion
-------------------------
CLion will invoke Bazel to build Drake, including the external dependencies
specified in the WORKSPACE file.

1. ``File > Import Bazel Project``
2. Select Workspace: Use an existing Bazel workspace, and provide the path to
   your ``drake-distro`` directory.
3. (Sometimes) Select Bazel Executable: If prompted, specify the path to your
   Bazel executable. The default is probably correct.
4. Select Project View: choose "Import from workspace", and
   select the file ``drake-distro/.bazelproject``
5. Project View: Pick a ``project data directory`` of your choice for the
   CLion project files. It must not be a subdirectory of ``drake-distro``.
6. (Advanced) Project View: If you only wish to develop a subset of Drake,
   you can specify only those files and targets in the project view file.
   Most users should leave it as-is.
7. Click "Finish".  CLion will begin ingesting the Drake source, building
   symbols, and compiling Drake. This will take several minutes.

Building and Running Targets
----------------------------

To build all of Drake with default Bazel options, select
``Bazel > Build > Compile Project``.

To build or run a specific target go to ``Run > Edit Configurations``. Click
``+`` to create a new Bazel command.  Specify the configuration name and Bazel
options. The ``Target expression`` specifies the actual code (library, binary,
and/or test) that you want to run. To learn more about target expressions, see
`the Bazel manual <https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/bazel-user-manual.html#target-patterns>`_.
Once you've created a configuration, you can launch it from the ``Run`` menu.

To run a specific target in the debugger, create a configuration as above,
using the ``bazel run`` command. Then launch it from ``Run > Debug``.

Keeping CLion Up-to-Date with the Bazel Build
---------------------------------------------

Changes to BUILD files can add or remove source files from the Bazel build.
To propagate those changes into the CLion project structure, select
``Bazel > Sync Project With BUILD Files``.

Git Integration
---------------

CLion provides a user interface for Git, which you can enable in the ``VCS``
menu.  It automatically detects all Git roots within the workspace. This will
include ``bazel-drake-distro``, which is a Bazel-internal detail. Bazel edits
the contents of that directory for its own purposes, and those changes will
spuriously appear in the CLion UI as changes that need to be committed. To make
CLion ignore ``bazel-drake-distro``, enable Git integration under the ``VCS``
tab, then go to ``File > Settings``. Select the ``Version Control`` menu item
directly (not one of the subtopics displayed when that item is expanded). You
will see a list of all the Git root directories. Look for ``bazel-drake-distro``
on that list and select it. On the right hand side are ``+`` and ``-`` buttons;
click ``-`` to remove the spurious root directory. After that you should be
able to go to ``VCS > Commit Changes`` and there should be no changes seen.

Integrating External Tools with CLion
=====================================

Code formatter settings
-----------------------

1. Make sure you have installed ``clang-format`` (see :doc:`code_style_tools`)
2. Go to File > Settings > Tools > External Tools
3. Add an entry for clang-format with

   * Program: ``clang-format``
   * Parameters (whole file): ``-i $FileName$``
   * Parameters (current selection only):
     ``-lines $SelectionStartLine$:$SelectionEndLine$ -i $FileName$``
   * Working directory : ``$FileDir$``

Choose one or the other of the parameter settings. Now you can run this
(manually) on any file using Tools > External Tools in the drop down menu. You
can also add a keyboard shortcut.

You can also set the coding style through the following steps

1. Go to File > Settings > Editor > Code Style
2. On the right panel, Go to Default Options > Right margin (columns): Set it to 80
3. Go to File > Settings > Editor > Code Style > C/C++
4. On the right panel, choose Set from > Predefined Style > Google

Integrating Cpplint in CLion
----------------------------
This will give you the ability to execute ``cpplint`` on a single file or the full
project and have the result presented in the CLion console with each warning
a clickable hyperlink.

(These instructions assume you are using CLion with Bazel, as you should be.
They are slightly different for CMake project organization.)

Creating the External Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. role:: raw-html(raw)
   :format: html

Run ``Cpplint`` on Single File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Open the Settings dialog (``File`` > ``Settings``) or ``Alt+Ctrl+S``.
2. Navigate to ``Tools`` > ``External Tools``.
3. Click the :raw-html:`<font size="5" color="green">+</font>` sign to add a new tool.
4. Add the following values in the following fields:

   :Name: ``Cpplint File``
   :Description: ``Apply cpplint to the current file.``
   :Program: ``$Projectpath$/drake/common/test/cpplint_wrapper.py``
   :Parameters: ``$FilePath$``
   :Working directory: <empty> (CLion may set this; if so leave it.)
5. Make sure that *only* the following Options are checked (the
   ``Synchronize files after execution`` is unnecessary because cpplint is
   a read-only operation):

   - ``Open Console``
   - ``Main Menu``
   - ``Editor Menu``
   - ``Project views``
6. Click the ``Output Filters...`` button.
7. Click the :raw-html:`<font size="5" color="green">+</font>` sign to add a filter.
8. Add the following values in the following fields (and click "OK):

   :Name: ``Extract Links``
   :Description: ``Convert file/line references into clickable links.``
   :Regular expression to match output: ``$FILE_PATH$:$LINE$``
9. Click ``OK`` on the ``Edit filter`` dialog.
10. Click ``OK`` on the ``Output Filters`` dialog.

Run ``CppLint`` on Full Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Repeat the steps from creating the single-file version with the following
differences:

4. Set the fields as follows:

    :Name: ``Cpplint Project``
    :Description: ``Apply cpplint to the entire project.``
    :Program: ``$Projectpath$/drake/common/test/cpplint_wrapper.py``
    :Parameters: <empty>
    :Working directory: <empty> (CLion may set this; if so leave it.)

Continue on with steps 5 to the end.

Executing
^^^^^^^^^
The external tools you've created can be exercised in one of several ways,
depending on whether you're doing a single-file or full-project operation.

To check a single file, select the file that you want to be worked on to be
"active".  This can be done by clicking on the file so the cursor lies in
the file, or by clicking on the file's tab.  The path to the active file
will be displayed in the title bar.

Once the file is "active", the ``Cpplint File`` External Tool can be invoked
in two ways:

1. Right-click on the document (or tab) and select ``External Tools`` >
   ``Cpplint File``, or
2. in the menu bar, select ``Tools`` > ``External Tools`` > ``Cpplint File``

To check the whole project, in the menu bar, select ``Tools`` >
``External Tools`` > ``Cpplint Project``. Alternatively, this can also be
done through the right-click context menu.
