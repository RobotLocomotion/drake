Doxygen Instructions
********************

This section contains instructions on how to use
`Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`_ with Drake.

.. _doxygen-style-guide:

Doxygen Style Guide
===================

Coming soon. See issue
`#2051 <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/2051>`_ and PR
`#2359 <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/pull/2359>`_.

.. _doxygen-generation:

Doxygen Website Generation
==========================
First enable the ``documentation`` build target by executing the following::

    $ cd [build artifacts directory]
    $ cmake -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON ..

There are at least two ways to generate Drake's Doxygen website. The first is
using the command line, and the second through Microsoft Visual Studio.

.. _doxygen-generation-command-line:

Using the Command Line
----------------------
To build the documentation via the command line, execute::

    $ cd [build artifacts directory]
    $ make documentation

To view the generated Doxygen website, open the following file using your
favorite web browser::

    [build artifacts directory]/doc/doxygen_cxx/html/index.html

**Note 1:** If you're building Drake in-source (i.e., within the ``pod-build``
directory), the ``[build artifacts directory]`` is typically
``[drake distro]/drake/pod-build/``.

** Note 2:** By enabling the ``BUILD_DOCUMENTATION`` cmake option, the
documentation will be built *every* time you compile Drake. To stop this
behavior, see the instructions below on how to disable documentation
generation.

.. _doxygen-generation-visual-studio:

Using Microsoft Visual Studio
-----------------------------

In Visual Studio, there is a ``documentation`` target that's visible through the
Solution Explorer, as shown below:

.. image:: images/doxygen_instructions/visual_studio_build_targets.png

To build the documentation, simply select and build the ``documentation`` target
in the IDE. Note that in Microsoft Visual Studio, the ``documentation`` target
is not built when building the other targets, meaning there is one less reason
to disable the ``documentation`` target.

.. _disable-doxygen-generation:

Disabling Documentation Generation
----------------------------------

To disable documentation generation, simply execute::

    $ cd [build artifacts directory]
    $ cmake -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=OFF ..
    $ make
