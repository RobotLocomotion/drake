Using Drake from Matlab
***********************

We are currently implementing the MATLAB bindings for Drake's new C++ libraries.
Stay tuned for more information.

In the meantime,

===============

Prior to 2016, Drake was built around a substantial base of MATLAB software.
Most of that was removed from the head of git master during 2017.
