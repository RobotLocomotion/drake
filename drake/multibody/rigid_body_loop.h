 * `RigidBodyFrame` objects that must be attached to two different `RigidBody`
 * objects. The coordinate frames defined by the two `RigidBodyFrame` objects
 * are constrained to have the same origin. The orientations of the two frames
 * are partially constrained based on the axis of rotation (i.e., the two frames
 * are only allowed to rotate relative to each other along the axis of
 * rotation).
