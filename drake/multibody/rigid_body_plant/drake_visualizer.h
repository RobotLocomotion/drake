/**
 * This is a Drake System 2.0 block that takes a RigidBodyTree and publishes LCM
 * messages that are intended for the DrakeVisualizer. It does this in two
 * phases: initialization, which runs when DoPublish() is called with
 * Context::get_time() equal to zero, and run-time, which runs every time
 * DoPublish() is called.
 *
 * During initialization, this system block analyzes the RigidBodyTree and tells
 * Drake Visualizer what it will be visualizing. For example, these include the
 * number of rigid bodies, their dimensions, and colors. The LCM message used
 * during this phase is called `lcmt_viewer_load_robot` and the channel name is
 * "DRAKE_VIEWER_LOAD_ROBOT".
 *
 * During run-time, this system block takes the current state of the model and
 * tells Drake Visualizer how to visualize the model. For example, this includes
 * the position and orientation of each rigid body. The LCM messages used during
 * this phase is `lcmt_viewer_draw` and the channel name is
 * "DRAKE_VIEWER_DRAW".
 *
 * The visualizer has an option that causes it to save the state it dispatches
 * for drawing and allows replay of that cached data at wall clock time --
 * i.e., one second of simulation is played back for every second in the real
 * world.  The playback *rate* is currently capped at 60 Hz.  This is useful
 * for immediate review of simulations which evaluate at time rates radically
 * out of scale with wall clock time, enabling intuitive understanding of the
 * simulation results.  See ReplayCachedSimulation().
