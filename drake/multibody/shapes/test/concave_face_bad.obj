# This OBJ facilitates testing the triangulation functionality of the
# DrakeShapes::Mesh class. The final face needs to be triangulated.  However,
# creating a fan from the first vertex will create overlapping triangles with
# reversed normals.
#
# The is a pyramid-like shape.  The base of the pyramid, however, is concave.
# The fan is formed at vertex 0.  In this case, the winding of (0, 1, 2) is
# opposite of the winding of (0, 2, 3) so the overlapping face will be
# detected and triangulation will fail.
