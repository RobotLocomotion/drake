# This OBJ consists of two faces.  Neither face is planar.  Viewed from the
# "right" direction, the faces look like this:
#
#     \      /
#      \    /
#       \  /
#        \/
#
# The first face has a dihedral angle of slightly less than 30 degrees and
# *should* triangulate.
# The second face has a dihedral angle of slightly more than 30 degrees and
# should *not* parse.
#
# 30 degrees is the documented threshold in DrakeShapes::Mesh
