# This OBJ facilitates testing the triangulation functionality of the
# DrakeShapes::Mesh class. The final face needs to be triangulated.  However,
# it is concave. But the ordering of the vertices admits a viable triangulation.
#
# The is a pyramid-like shape.  The base of the pyramid, however, is concave.
# The fan is formed at vertex 0.  In this case, the fan is valid.
