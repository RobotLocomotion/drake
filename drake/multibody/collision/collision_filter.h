/**
 The specification of a collision filter group: its name, bodies that belong
 to it, and the names of collision filter groups that it ignores.  This
 class is used for initialization and not run-time calculations.

 A collision filter group is a mechanism for cheaply culling pairs of collision
 elements from consideration during collision detection. One collision filter
 group associates a set of bodies with a set of *ignored* collision filter
 groups.  At runtime, when a pair of bodies @f$(A, B)@f$ are determined to be a
 collision candidate, their collision filter group membership is examined.

 Given the following definitions:

   - @f$G(A) ≜ \{g^A_0, g^A_1, ..., g^A_n\}@f$ is the set of all groups
     to which @f$A@f$ belongs,
   - @f$I(f) ≜ \{g^f_0, g^f_1, ..., g^f_m\}@f$ is the set set of all
     groups that group @f$f@f$ ignores,
   - @f$I(A) ≜ \{I(g^A_0) \cap I(g^A_1) \cap ... \cap I(g^A_n)\}@f$
     such that @f$g^A_i \in G(A)@f$ is the set of all groups that @f$A@f$
     ignores.

 Then, the pair @f$(A, B)@f$ will be filtered if:

    @f$I(A) \cap G(B) \ne \emptyset \lor I(B) \cap G(A) \ne \emptyset@f$.

 In other words, if either body belongs to a group which is ignored by *any*
 group the other body belongs to.

/**
 This class provides management utilities for the definition of collision filter
 groups for RigidBodyTree instances.

 The intent of the manager is to serve as an accumulator during the *parsing*
 process.  It serves as an intermediate representation of the collision filter
 group semantics. A unique instance should be owned by each RigidBodyTree
 instance.

 The manager is used in parsing *sessions*.  By design, one session maps to
 parsing a single file.  The session ends with a call to Clear() (called in
 RigidBodyTree::compile()).  Multiple sessions can be run on a single manager
 (this naturally arises from parsing multiple files).  Collision filter groups
 defined during a single session must all have unique group *names*. Names
 repeated in different sessions are treated as being *different* collision
 filter groups.  The names of the groups are only maintained during parsing.
 During compilation, the names are replaced with integer identifiers.

 The group manager can handle a finite number of groups
 (kMaxNumCollisionFilterGroups).  Each session contributes towards reaching
 that total.  If the maximum number of groups has been defined, subsequent
 efforts to define a new collision filter group will cause exceptions to be
 thrown.

 There are several implications of this design:

    - Collision filter groups have a scope limited to a single URDF file. That
      means a collision filter group *cannot* be configured between bodies
      defined in different URDF files.
    - Even if the same file is parsed multiple times, leading to collision
      filter groups with identical names in each session, the groups will be
      considered different.  Bodies from one parsing of the file will not be
      in groups visible to another parsing.
    - A user cannot change the collision filter groups a body belongs to or
      which groups it ignores outside of the URDF specification.
