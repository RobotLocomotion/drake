 * The `Element` combines three pieces of data:
 * - the geometric definition of the element's colliding shape (a `Geometry`
 *   instance referred to as its "geometry").
 * - the transform `T_element_to_local` (T_LE) giving the pose of the element's
 *   frame E in the body's local frame L, with the sense that p_L = T_LE * p_E
 *   for points measured and expressed in frames L and E, respectively.
 * - the `RigidBody` instance to which this element belongs (its "body").  A
 *   `RigidBody` *can* possess multiple collision `Element`s, but an `Element`
 *   can only belong to a single `RigidBody`.
