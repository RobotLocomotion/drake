/**
 * Adds a floating joint to each body specified by @p body_indices that does
 * not already have a parent.
 *
 * This method is only intended to be called by parsers since parsers add bodies
 * to the RigidBodyTree _en masse_. The logic in this method is necessary to
 * identify which of the rigid bodies specified by @p body_indices get floating
 * joints.
 *
 * When manually adding a model instance to the RigidBodyTree, i.e., directly
 * using the C++ API rather than via a parser, this method should _not_ be
 * necessary since floating joints can be directly added by calling
 * RigidBody::setJoint().
 *
 * @param[in] floating_base_type The floating joint's type.
 *
 * @param[in] body_indices A list of body indexes to check. A floating joint is
 * added to any body in this list that does not have a parent joint.
 *
 * @param[in] weld_to_frame The frame to which the floating joint should attach
 * the parent-less non-world bodies. This parameter may be nullptr, in which
 * case the body is welded to the world with zero offset.
 *
 * @param[in] pose_map A mapping where the key is the body's name and the value
 * is the transform from the frame of the body to the frame of the model to
 * which the body belongs. This parameter will may be nullptr, in which case an
 * identity transform is used.
 *
 * @param[out] tree The RigidBodyTree to which to add the floating joints.
 *
 * @return The number of floating joint added to this rigid body tree.
 *
 * @throws A std::runtime_error if the floating_base_type is unrecognized or
 * zero floating joints were added to the model.
