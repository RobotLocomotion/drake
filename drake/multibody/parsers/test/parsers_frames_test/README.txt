To load these models into Gazebo, first update environment variable
`GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH` by executing the following command:

    export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=`pwd`:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH

Then launch `gazebo`, switch to the "Insert" tab on the left hand side of
Gazebo's GUI, and import the desired model by clicking and dragging it into the
simulation.
