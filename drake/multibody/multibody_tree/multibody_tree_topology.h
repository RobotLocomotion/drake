/// @file
/// This file defines the topological structures which represent the logical
/// connectivities between multibody tree elements. For instance, the
/// BodyTopology for a Body will contain the topological information  specifying
/// its inboard (or parent) body in the parent tree, and its outboard (or
/// children) bodies, and the level or depth in the MultibodyTree.
/// All of this information is independent of the particular scalar type T the
/// MultibodyTree and its components are specialized with.
/// All of the data structures defined in this file are meant to be the most
/// minimalist representation that can store this information.
/// These data structures are used in the following ways:
///  - To aid the process of cloning or transmogrifying multibody tree
///    components without having to create maps between the "original" and
///    "cloned" objects. That process is tedious and error prone.
///  - Each Multibody tree element has a copy (acquired at
///    MultibodyTree::Finalize() stage) of its topology which serves as a
///    key into the Context for that element's state.
///  - The topology is also stored in the Context so that the Multibody tree's
///    topology can be validated against the stored topology in debug builds.
