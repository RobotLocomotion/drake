/// The term **rigid body** implies that the deformations of the body under
/// consideration are so small that they have no significant effect on the
/// overall motions of the body and therefore deformations can be neglected.
/// If deformations are neglected, the distance between any two points on the
/// rigid body remains constant at all times. This invariance of the distance
/// between two arbitrary points is often taken as the definition of a rigid
/// body in classical treatments of multibody mechanics [Goldstein 2001].
/// It can be demonstrated that the unconstrained three-dimensional motions of a
/// rigid body can be described by six coordinates and thus it is often said
/// that a free body in space has six **degrees of freedom**. These degrees of
/// freedom obey the Newton-Euler equations of motion. However, within a
/// MultibodyTree, a %RigidBody is *not* free in space; instead, it is assigned
/// a limited number of degrees of freedom (0-6) with respect to its parent
/// body in the multibody tree by its Mobilizer (also called a
/// "tree joint" or "inboard joint"). Additional constraints on permissible
/// motion can be added using Constraint objects to remove more degrees of
/// freedom.
