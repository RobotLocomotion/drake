/// The term **rigid body** implies that the deformations of the body under
/// consideration are so small that they have no significant effect on the
/// overall motions of the body and therefore deformations can be neglected.
/// If deformations are neglected, the distance between any two points on the
/// rigid body remains constant at all times. This invariance of the distance
/// between two arbitrary points is often taken as the definition of a rigid
/// body in classical treatments of multibody mechanics [Goldstein 2001].
/// It can be demonstrated that the unconstrained three-dimensional motions of a
/// rigid body can be described by six coordinates and thus it is often said
/// that a free body in space has six **degrees of freedom**. These degrees of
/// freedom obey the Newton-Euler equations of motion. Within a MultibodyTree,
/// a RigidBody is assigned a given number of degrees of freedom by a Mobilizer
/// while, at the same time, its motions can be constrained by a given set of
/// Constraint objects.
