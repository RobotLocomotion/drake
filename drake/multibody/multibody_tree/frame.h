/// %Frame is an abstract base class representation of the concept of a frame
/// in multibody dynamics. Frames can be thought of as a set of three orthogonal
/// axes forming a right-handed orthogonal basis located at a point called the
/// frame's origin.
/// It is important at this point to make the distinction between a _frame_,
/// and its _pose_ as measured and expressed in another frame. Even though
/// related, _frame_ and _pose_ are two different concepts. Given two frames E
/// and F, the pose `X_EF` of frame F measured and expressed in frame E defines
/// the geometrical relationship between these two frames.
/// This class does not store the pose `X_EF` of a frame but it only provides an
/// abstraction to represent the frame itself. Notice that storing any pose
/// `X_EF` within this class does not make sense since it would be imposible to
/// specify the pose of F without knowledge of a specific frame E in which its
/// pose is measured.
///
/// Sub-classes of %Frame are responsible for communicating useful semantics
/// about that frame's dependencies and providing implementations for defining
/// the pose based on those semantics. For instace, the pose of a frame could
/// be determined with the knowledge that it is attached to a body with a fixed
/// pose in the body frame. Another example is a frame that is attached to
/// a particular material point on a soft body. In that case the pose of the
/// frame will generally depend on the state of deformation of the body.
///
/// @tparam T The scalar type. Must be a valid Eigen scalar.
