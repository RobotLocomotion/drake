/// A %BodyFrame is a material Frame that serves as the unique reference frame
/// for a Body.
///
/// Each Body B, regardless of whether it represents a rigid body or a
/// flexible body, has a unique body frame for which we use the same symbol B
/// (with meaning clear from context). The body frame is also referred to as
/// a _reference frame_ in the literature for flexible body mechanics modeling
/// using the Finite Element Method. All properties of a body are defined with
/// respect to its body frame, including its mass properties and attachment
/// locations for joints, constraints, actuators, geometry and so on. Run time
/// motion of the body is defined with respect to the motion of its body frame.
/// We represent a body frame by a %BodyFrame object that is created whenever a
/// Body is constructed and is owned by the Body.
///
/// Note that the %BodyFrame associated with
/// a body does not necessarily need to be located at its center of mass nor
/// does it need to be aligned with the body's principal axes, although, in
/// practice, it frequently is.
/// For flexible bodies, %BodyFrame provides a representation for the body's
/// reference frame. The flexible degrees of freedom associated with a flexible
/// body describe the body's deformation in this frame. Therefore, the motion of
/// a flexible body is defined by the motion of its %BodyFrame, or reference
/// frame, plus the motion of the material points on the body with respect to
/// its %BodyFrame.
///
/// A %BodyFrame and Body are tightly coupled concepts; neither makes sense
/// without the other. Therefore, a %BodyFrame instance is constructed in
/// conjunction with its Body and cannot be
/// constructed anywhere else. However, you can still access the frame
/// associated with a body, see Body::get_body_frame().
/// This access is more than a convenience; you can use the %BodyFrame to
/// define other frames on the body and to attach other multibody elements
/// to it.
