/// %Mobilizer is a fundamental object within Drake's multibody engine used to
/// specify the allowed motions between two Frame objects within a
/// MultibodyTree. Specifying the allowed motions between two Frame objects
/// effectively also specifies a kinematic relationship between the two bodies
/// associated with those two frames. Consider the following example to build a
/// simple pendulum system:
///
/// @code
/// MultibodyTree<double> model;
/// // ... Code here to setup quantities below as mass, com, X_BP, etc. ...
/// const Body<double>& pendulum =
///   model.AddBody<RigidBody>(SpatialInertia<double>(mass, com, unit_inertia));
/// // We will connect the pendulum body to the world frame using a
/// // RevoluteMobilizer. To do so we define a pin frame P rigidly attached to
/// // the pendulum body.
/// FixedOffsetFrame<double>& pin_frame =
///   model.AddFrame<FixedOffsetFrame>(
///     pendulum.get_body_frame(),
///     X_BP /* pose of pin frame P in body frame B */);
/// // The mobilizer connects the world frame and the pin frame effectively
/// // adding the single degree of freedom describing this system. In this
/// // regard, the the role of a mobilizer is equivalent but conceptually
/// // different than a set of constraints that effectively remove all degrees
/// // of freedom but the one permitting rotation about the z-axis.
/// const RevoluteMobilizer<double>& revolute_mobilizer =
///   model.AddMobilizer<RevoluteMobilizer>(
///     model.get_world_frame(), /* inboard frame */
///     pin_frame, /* outboard frame */
///     Vector3d::UnitZ() /* revolute axis in this case */));
/// @endcode
///
/// A %Mobilizer induces a tree structure within a MultibodyTree
/// model, connecting an inboard (topologically closer to the world) frame to an
/// outboard (topologically further from the world) frame. Every time a
/// %Mobilizer is added to a MultibodyTree (using the
/// MultibodyTree::AddMobilizer() method), a number of degrees of
/// freedom associated with the particular type of %Mobilizer are added to the
/// multibody system. In the example above for the single pendulum, adding a
/// RevoluteMobilizer has two purposes:
/// - It defines the tree structure of the model. World is the inboard body
///   while "pendulum" is the outboard body in the MultibodyTree.
/// - It informs the MultibodyTree of the degrees of freedom granted by the
///   revolute mobilizer between the two frames it connects.
/// - It defines a permissible motion space spanned by the generalized
///   coordinates introduced by the mobilizer.
///
/// A %Mobilizer describes the kinematics relationship between an inboard frame
/// F and an outboard frame M, introducing an nq-dimensional vector of
/// generalized coordinates q and an nv-dimensional vector of generalized
/// velocities v. Notice that in general `nq != nv`, though `nq == nv` is a very
/// common case. The kinematic relationships introduced by a %Mobilizer are
/// fully specified by, [Seth 2010]:
/// - X_FM(q): The pose of the outboard frame M as measured and expressed in the
///            inboard frame F, as a function of the mobilizer's generalized
///            positions.
/// - H_FM(q): the Jacobian matrix describing the relationship between
///            generalized velocities v and the spatial velocity `V_FM` by
///            `V_FM(q, v) = H_FM(q) * v`. `H_FM` is a `6 x nv` matrix.
///            See [Jain 2010] for details.
/// - Hdot_FM(q): The time derivative of the Jacobian matrix allowing to compute
///               the spatial acceleration between the F and M frames:
///               `A_FM(q, v) = Vdot_FM(q, v) = H_FM(q) * vdot + Hdot_FM(q) * v`
/// - N(q): The kinematic coupling matrix describing the relationship between
///         the rate of change of generalized coordinates and the generalized
///         velocities by `qdot = N(q) * v`, [Seth 2010]. N(q) is an `nq x nv`
///         matrix.
///
/// In general, `nv != nq`. As an example, consider a quaternion mobilizer that
/// would allow frame M to move freely with respect to frame F. For such a
/// mobilizer the generalized positions vector might contain a quaternion to
/// describe rotations plus a position vector to describe translations. However,
/// we might choose the angular velocity `w_FM` and the linear velocity `v_FM`
/// as the generalized velocities (or more generally, the spatial velocity
/// `V_FM`.) In such a case `nq = 7` (4 dofs for a quaternion plus 3 dofs for a
/// position vector) and `nv = 6` (3 dofs for an angular velocity and 3 dofs for
/// a linear velocity).
///
/// For a detailed discussion on the concept of a mobilizer please refer to
/// [Seth 2010]. The Jacobian or "Hinge" matrix `H_FM(q)` is introduced in
/// [Jain 2010], though be aware that what [Jain 2010] calls the hinge matrix is
/// the transpose of the Jacobian H_FM matrix here in Drake.
/// For details in the monogram notation used above please refer to
/// @ref multibody_spatial_algebra.

/// derived %Mobilizer objects must implement in order to fully define the
