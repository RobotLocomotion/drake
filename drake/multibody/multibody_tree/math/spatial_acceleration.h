/// Y measured with respect to a "measured-in" frame X, the %SpatialAcceleration
/// `A_XY` represents the rate of change of this spatial velocity `V_XY` in
/// frame X. That is @f$^XA^Y = \frac{^Xd}{dt}\,{^XV^Y} @f$ where
/// @f$\frac{^Xd}{dt} @f$ denotes the time derivative taken in frame X. That is,
/// to compute an acceleration we need to specify in what frame the time
/// derivative is taken, see [Mitiguy 2016, ยง6.1] for a more in depth discussion
/// on this. Time derivatives can be taken in different frames, and they
/// transform according to the "Transport Theorem", which is in Drake is
/// implemented in drake::math::ConvertTimeDerivativeToOtherFrame().
/// In source code comments we write `A_XY = DtX(V_XY)`, where `DtX()` is the
/// operator that takes the time derivative in the X frame.
/// By convention, and unless otherwise stated, we assume that the frame in
/// which the time derivative is taken is the "measured-in" frame, i.e. the time
/// derivative used in `A_XY` is in frame X by default (i.e. DtX()).
/// To perform numerical computations, we need to specify an "expressed-in"
/// frame E (which may be distinct from either X or Y), so that components can
/// be expressed as real numbers.
/// Only the vector values are stored in a %SpatialAcceleration object; the
/// frames must be understood from context and it is the responsibility of the
/// user to keep track of them. That is best accomplished through disciplined
/// notation.
/// In source code we use monogram notation where capital A is used to designate
/// a spatial acceleration quantity. The same monogram notation rules for
/// SpatialVelocity are also used for %SpatialAcceleration. That is, the spatial
/// acceleration of a frame Y measured in X and expressed in E is denoted with

  /// Recall that frame `Pb` is an offset frame rigidly aligned with P, but with

  /// </pre>
  /// Therefore, for the translational acceleration we have: <pre>
  ///   a_WBo = DtW(v_WPb)
  ///         = DtW(v_WPo + w_WP x p_PoBo)
  ///         = DtW(v_WPo) + DtW(w_WP x p_PoBo)

  /// </pre>
  /// with `a_WPo = DtW(v_WPo)` and `alpha_WP = DtW(w_WP)` by definition.

  /// since `v_PBo = DtP(p_PoBo) = 0` because the position of point `Bo` is
