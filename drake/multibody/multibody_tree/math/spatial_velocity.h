template <typename T> class SpatialForce;

/// This class is used to represent a _spatial velocity_ (also called a
/// _twist_) that combines rotational (angular) and translational
/// (linear) velocity components. Spatial velocities are 6-element
/// quantities that are pairs of ordinary 3-vectors. Elements 0-2 are
/// the angular velocity component while elements 3-5 are the translational
/// velocity. Spatial velocities represent the motion of a "moving frame"
/// B measured with respect to a "measured-in" frame A. In addition,
/// the two contained vectors must be expressed in the same "expressed-in"
/// frame E, which may be distinct from either A or B. Finally,
/// while angular velocity is identical for any frame fixed to a rigid
/// body, translational velocity refers to a particular point. Only the
/// vector values are stored in a %SpatialVelocity object; the three
/// frames and the point must be understood from context. It is the
/// responsibility of the user to keep track of them. That is best
/// accomplished through disciplined notation. In source code we use
/// monogram notation where capital V is used to designate a spatial
/// velocity quantity. We write a point P fixed to body (or frame)
/// B as @f$B_P@f$ which appears in code and comments as `Bp`. Then
/// we write a particular spatial velocity as `V_ABp_E` where the `_E`
/// suffix indicates that the expressed-in frame is E. This symbol
/// represents the angular velocity of frame B in frame A, and the
/// translational velocity of point P in A, where P is fixed to
/// frame B, with both vectors expressed in E. Very often
/// the point of interest will be the body origin `Bo`; if no point is
/// shown the origin is understood, so `V_AB_E` means `V_ABo_E`.
/// For a more detailed introduction on spatial vectors and the monogram
/// notation please refer to section @ref multibody_spatial_vectors.
///
/// @tparam T The underlying scalar type. Must be a valid Eigen scalar.
