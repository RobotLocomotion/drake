/// A scalar multi-variate piecewise polynomial.
/**
 * PiecewisePolynomial represents a list of contiguous segments in time with a
 * Matrix of Polynomials defined for each segment. The term segment is used for
 * piece.
 *
 * An example of a piecewise polynomial is a function of x segments in time,
 * where for each segment a different polynomial is defined. For a more specific
 * example, consider the absolute value function, which is a piecewise function.
 * It uses one function for inputs values < 0, and another function for input
 * values > 0:
 *
 * @code
 * int abs(int x)
 * {
 *   if (x<0) {
 *     return -x;
     }
 *   else return x;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * PiecewisePolynomials can be added, subtracted, and multiplied.
 * They cannot be divided because Polynomials are not closed
 * under division.
