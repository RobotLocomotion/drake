 * For a non-convex homogeneous quadratic form xᵀQx, where Q is not necessarily
 * a positive semidefinite matrix, we decompose it as a difference between two
 * convex homogeneous quadratic forms
 * xᵀQx = xᵀQ₁x - xᵀQ₂x,
 * Q₁, Q₂ are positive semidefinite.
 * To find the optimal Q₁ and Q₂, we solve the following semidefinite
 * programming problem
 * min s
 * s.t s >= trace(Q₁)
 *     s >= trace(Q₂)
 *     Q₁ - Q₂ = (Q + Qᵀ) / 2
 *     Q₁, Q₂ are positive semidefinite
 * The decomposition Q = Q₁ - Q₂ can be used later, to solve the non-convex
 * optimization problem involving a quadratic form xᵀQx.

/**
 * For a non-convex quadratic constraint
 *   lb ≤ xᵀQ₁x - xᵀQ₂x + pᵀy ≤ ub
 * where Q₁, Q₂ are both positive semidefinite matrices. `y` is a vector that
 * can overlap with `x`. We relax this non-convex constraint by several convex
 * constraints. The steps are
 * 1. Introduce two new variables z₁, z₂, to replace xᵀQ₁x and xᵀQ₂x
 *    respectively. The constraint becomes
 *    <pre>
 *      lb ≤ z₁ - z₂ + pᵀy ≤ ub              (1)
 *    </pre>
 * 2. Ideally, we would like to enforce z₁ = xᵀQ₁x and z₂ = xᵀQ₂x through convex
 *    constraints. To this end, we first bound z₁ and z₂ from below, as
 *    <pre>
 *      z₁ ≥ xᵀQ₁x                            (2)
 *      z₂ ≥ xᵀQ₂x                            (3)
 *    </pre>
 *    These two constraints are second order cone
 *    constraints.
 * 3. To bound z₁ and z₂ from above, we linearize the quadratic forms
 *    xᵀQ₁x and xᵀQ₂x at a point x₀. Due to the convexity of the quadratic
 *    form, we know that given a positive scalar d > 0, there exists a
 *    neighbourhood N(x₀)
 *    around x₀, s.t ∀ x ∈ N(x₀)
 *    <pre>
 *    xᵀQ₁x ≤ 2 x₀ᵀQ₁(x - x₀) + x₀ᵀQ₁x₀ + d   (4)
 *    xᵀQ₂x ≤ 2 x₀ᵀQ₂(x - x₀) + x₀ᵀQ₂x₀ + d   (5)
 *    </pre>
 *    Notice N(x₀) is the intersection of two ellipsoids, as formulated in (4)
 *    and (5).
 *    Therefore, we also enforce the linear constraints
 *    <pre>
 *      z₁ ≤ 2 x₀ᵀQ₁(x - x₀) + x₀ᵀQ₁x₀ + d    (6)
 *      z₂ ≤ 2 x₀ᵀQ₂(x - x₀) + x₀ᵀQ₂x₀ + d    (7)
 *    </pre>
 *    So we relax the original non-convex constraint, with the convex
 *    constraints (1)-(3), (6) and (7).
 *
 * The trust region is the neighbourhood N(x₀) around x₀, such that the
 * inequalities (4), (5) are satisfied ∀ x ∈ N(x₀).
 *
 * The positive scalar d controls both how much the constraint relaxation is
 * (the original constraint can be violated by at most d), and how big the trust
 * region is.
 *
 * If there is a solution satisfying the relaxed constraint, this solution
 * can violate the original non-convex constraint by at most d; on the other
 * hand, if there is not a solution satisfying the relaxed constraint, it
 * proves that the original non-convex constraint does not have a solution
 * in the trust region.
 *
 * This approach is outlined in section III of
 *   On Time Optimization of Centroidal Momentum Dynamics
 *   by Brahayam Ponton, Alexander Herzog, Stefan Schaal and Ludovic Righetti,
 *   ICRA, 2018
 *
 * The special cases are when Q₁ = 0 or Q₂ = 0.
 * 1. When Q₁ = 0, the original constraint becomes
 *    lb ≤ -xᵀQ₂x + pᵀy ≤ ub
 *    If ub = +∞, then the original constraint is the convex rotated Lorentz
 *    cone constraint xᵀQ₂x ≤ pᵀy - lb. The user should not call this function
 *    to relax this convex constraint.
 *    @throws std::runtime_error if Q₁ = 0 and ub = +∞.
 *    If ub < +∞, then we introduce a new variable z, with the constraints
 *    lb ≤ -z + pᵀy ≤ ub
 *    z ≥ xᵀQ₂x
 *    z ≤ 2 x₀ᵀQ₂(x - x₀) + x₀ᵀQ₂x₀ + d
 * 2. When Q₂ = 0, the constraint becomes
 *    lb ≤ xᵀQ₁x + pᵀy ≤ ub
 *    If lb = -∞, then the original constraint is the convex rotated Lorentz
 *    cone constraint xᵀQ₁x ≤ ub - pᵀy. The user should not call this function
 *    to relax this convex constraint.
 *    @throws std::runtime_error if Q₂ = 0 and lb = -∞.
 *    If lb > -∞, then we introduce a new variable z, with the constraints
 *    lb ≤ z + pᵀy ≤ ub
 *    z ≥ xᵀQ₁x
 *    z ≤ 2 x₀ᵀQ₁(x - x₀) + x₀ᵀQ₁x₀ + d
 * 3. If both Q₁ and Q₂ are zero, then the original constraint is a convex
 *    linear constraint lb ≤ pᵀx ≤ ub. The user should not call this function
 *    to relax this convex constraint. Throw a runtime error.
