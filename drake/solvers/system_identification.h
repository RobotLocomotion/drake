/**
 * This class is a holder for templated utility methods.  It should not be
 * constructed.  It must be template-instantiated (in its cpp file) for each
 * supported variant of Polynomial (currently only Polynomial<double>).
 *
 * For the purposes of system identification we require here that the set of
 * variables in a polynomial can be divided into two groups:
 *
 *  * "Parameter variables" are unchanged through many evaluations of the
 *    Polynomial and so may be factored and renamed (lumped) at will.  In
 *    effect parameter variables are treated as constants.
 *
 *  * "Active variables" are those that may vary between evaluations of the
 *    Polynomial, for instance because they are inputs or state variables
 *    of the system.
 *
 * Note: The term "system identification" used throughout here refers to the
 * process of simplifying the equations defining a physical system to a
 * minimum number of "lumped" parameters and then estimating the values of
 * those parameters based on empirical data.  For reference, see e.g.:
 *   https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3432353/parameterEstimation.pdf
