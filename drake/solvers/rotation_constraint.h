/// @file Functions for reasoning about 3D rotations in a @MathematicalProgram.
///
/// There are a number of choices for representing 3D rotations in a
/// mathematical program -- many of these choices involve using more than
/// the minimal three parameters and therefore require additional constraints
/// For example:
///  - the 4 parameters of a quaternion should form a vector with unit length.
///  - the 9 parameters of a rotation matrix should form a matrix which is
///    orthonormal (R.transpose() = R.inverse()) and det(R)=1.
///
/// Unfortunately, in the context of mathematical programming, most of these
/// constraints are non-convex.  The methods below include convex relaxations
/// of these non-convex constraints.

// TODO(all): Other concepts to potentially implement:
//  - PSDlift from section 1.2 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4914.pdf .  This
//    is waiting on the symbolic expression tools.
//  - Principle minor SOCP relaxations of the SDP conditions
//  - MILP constraints that push outside the cube contained by the L2 ball,
//    with vertices at (sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(3)/3), (-sqrt(3)/3,
//    sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(3)/3), ... this would have 6 faces/binary variables per
//    column of R instead of the 8 in the L1 norm constraint.
//  - Axis angle and/or gaze cone constraints, as mentioned here:
// https://reviewable.io/reviews/robotlocomotion/drake/4653#-K_YGsAOBY5ooX3OBqo7

/**
 * Adds binary variables that constrain the value of the column *and* row
 * vectors of R, in order to add the following (in some cases non-convex)
 * constraints as an MILP.  Specifically, for column vectors Ri, we constrain:
 * - forall i, |Ri| = 1 ± envelope,
 * - forall i,j. i ≠ j, Ri.dot(Rj) = 0 ± envelope,
 * - R2 = R0.cross(R1) ± envelope,
 *      and again for R0=R1.cross(R2), and R1=R2.cross(R0).
 * Then all of the same constraints are also added to R^T.  The size of the
 * envelope decreases quickly as num_binary_variables_per_half_axis is
 * is increased.
 *
 * Note: Creates `9*2*num_binary_variables_per_half_axis binary` variables named
 * "BRpos*(*,*)" and "BRneg*(*,*)", and the same number of continuous variables
 * named "CRpos*(*,*)" and "CRneg*(*,*)".
 *
 * Note: The particular representation/algorithm here was developed in an
 * attempt:
 *  - to enable efficient reuse of the variables between the constraints
 *    between multiple rows/columns (e.g. the constraints on R^T use the same
 *    variables as the constraints on R), and
 *  - to facilitate branch-and-bound solution techniques -- binary regions are
 *    layered so that constraining one region establishes constraints
 *    on large portions of SO(3), and confers hopefully "useful" constraints
 *    the on other binary variables.
 * @param prog The mathematical program to which the constraints are added.
 * @param R The rotation matrix
 * @param num_binary_vars_per_half_axis number of binary variables for a half
 * axis.
 * @param limits The angle joints for space fixed z-y-x representation of the
 * rotation. @default is no constraint. @see RollPitchYawLimitOptions
 * @retval NewVars  Included the newly added variables
 * <CRpos, CRneg, BRpos, BRneg>. All new variables can only take values either
 * 0 or 1. `CRpos` and `CRneg` are declared as continuous variables, while
 * `BRpos` and `BRneg` are declared as binary variables.
 * The definition for these variables are
 * <pre>
 *   CRpos[k](i, j) = 1 => k / N <= R(i, j) <= (k+1) / N
 *   CRneg[k](i, j) = 1 => -(k+1) / N <= R(i, j) <= -k / N
 *   BRpos[k](i, j) = 1 => R(i, j) >= k / N
 *   BRneg[k](i, j) = 1 => R(i, j) <= -k / N
 * </pre>
 * where `N` is `num_binary_vars_per_half_axis`.
