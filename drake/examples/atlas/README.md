This directory contains models for Atlas.

Historical note
---------------

Prior to 2016, Drake was built around a substantial base of MATLAB software.
Most of that was removed from the head of git master during 2017.

To view or use the original MATLAB implementation of Atlas you may use this tag:

For progress updates on the re-implementation, see
