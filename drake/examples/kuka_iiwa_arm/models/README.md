This directory contains numerous models that are useful to simulations involving
the KUKA iiwa arm. For more details, see the `model.config` files within their
subdirectories. This directory is organized similarly to the
[model database structure](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=model_structure&cat=build_robot.%3C/p%3E#ModelDatabaseStructure).
It differs from the model database structure in that in addition to SDF, STL,
and COLLADA files, it also contains models containing URDF and Wavefront OBJ
files.
