How to run SimpleCar simulations
================================

Additional prerequisite
-----------------------

Install `pygame` (e.g. with `brew install pygame`, or `apt-get install python-pygame`)

Running the simulator
---------------------

The following notes are for Ubuntu Linux and OS X users.

```
$ drake-distro/drake/examples/SimpleCar/simple_car_demo.sh
```

Ensure that the (very small) `pygame` window has focus, then use your
arrow keys and/or joystick to drive around.

Use Ctrl-C in your terminal to stop and close the demo.
