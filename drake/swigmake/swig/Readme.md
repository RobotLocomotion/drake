# Swigfiles

Useful SWIG interface files for common tasks. Currently includes:

* eigen.i: defines conversion functions between Eigen C++ Matrix types and numpy arrays. Adapted from https://bitbucket.org/MartinFelis/eigen3swig/src
* numpy.i: defines the interface for constructing and reading numpy arrays. Provided by http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/swig.interface-file.html and copied here for convenience.
