/**
 * @file
 * This file includes conversions from roll-pitch-yaw representation,

 *
 * The old file roll_pitch_yaw.h was separated into two half-files, namely:
 * roll_pitch_yaw_not_using_quaternion.h and roll_pitch_yaw_using_quaternion.h,
 * so quaternion.h can include roll_pitch_yaw_not_using_quaternion.h
 * to call rpy2rotmat in quaternion.h, without circular dependency problems.
 *
 * Most users should just include roll_pitch_yaw.h (ignore the half-files).
