# When bazelisk in use (as is typical, per Drake install_prereqs), this dotfile
# specifies which version of Bazel should be used to build and test Drake.
# Keep the in sync with doc/_pages/from_source.md (only the major.minor part).
USE_BAZEL_VERSION=7.4.0

# For some reason the google mirrors are very flaky in Drake CI in EC2, so
# we'll point to the GitHub mirrors instead.
