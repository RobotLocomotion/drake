*************
Drake v0.21.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

On macOS, Homebrew now symlinks Drake's compatible version of Python 3 (3.8)
into ``/usr/local/bin/``, so it is on the ``$PATH`` by default.  There is no
longer any need to add ``/usr/local/opt/python@3.8/bin`` to your ``$PATH``.
