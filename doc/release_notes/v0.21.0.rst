*************
Drake v0.21.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

On macOS, Homebrew now symlinks Drake's compatible version of Python 3 (3.8)
into ``/usr/local/bin/``, so it is on the ``$PATH`` by default.  There is no
longer any need to add ``/usr/local/opt/python@3.8/bin`` to your ``$PATH``.

Notes
-----

This release provides `pre-compiled binaries
<https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v0.21.0>`__ named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{bionic|focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See :ref:`Nightly Releases
<nightly-releases>` for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of `SNOPT
<https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/>`__ as part of the
`Mathematical Program toolbox
<https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html>`__. Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.

  Current newest_commit 0c692498d85bc2fef70a3d1e23a8e97c820388e6 (inclusive).

* Update TAMSI to consume fn0 instead of phi0 (`#13696`_)  # Prepare TAMSI to be agnostic to where the contact pairs stems from; point contact or discrete hydro.
* checks for positive penetration_allowance (`#13694`_)
* Specialize QuadraticCost evaluation for AutoDiff (`#13674`_)  # Specialize QuadraticCost evaluation for analytical computation of the gradients which was measured to be 15% faster then when using AutoDiffXd on use cases with dirtlib.
* doc: Add v0.20.0 warning about GoJS (`#13721`_)
* Fixes sub-stepping update of fn0 (`#13712`_)
* framework: Remove GoJS from GenerateHtml; rendering is now broken (`#13720`_)  # The implementation of GenerateHtml has been temporarily removed from Drake due to licensing restrictions.  The function will return valid HTML, but will not produce any useful rendering.
