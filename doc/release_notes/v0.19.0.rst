*************
Drake v0.19.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

.. warning::

  On macOS, Drake only supports Python 3.8.  Users **must** read `#13097`_ for
  upgrade instructions.

  When paths are set incorrectly, you will see an error such as this::

      ImportError: Python version mismatch: module was compiled for Python 3.8, but the interpreter version is incompatible: 3.7.7

* RigidBodyPlant and all of the drake "attic" is scheduled for removal on
  2020-09-01 (`#12158`_, `#13030`_).

  * Please see `#12158`_ for details of the timeline, and let us know if this
    will cause a problem.

* A new tutorial on updating costs/constraints in mathematical program is
  available (`#13328`_).

Breaking changes since v0.18.0
------------------------------

These are breaking changes that did not undergo a deprecation period:

* Remove the incorrect drakeURDF.[xpr|xsd] files (`#13326`_)

  * The schema defined in drakeURDF.xsd is significantly out of date. For now,
    we remove it so as to avoid the suggestion that it is reliable.

* Removes dead code IntegratorBase::InitializeAccuracy() (`#12624`_)

Changes since v0.18.0:
----------------------

Dynamical Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features

* Suppress symbolic feedthrough check if non-default output prerequisites were specified (`#13370`_)
* Use Eigen's formatting in VectorBase::operator<<() (`#13365`_, `#13384`_, `#13464`_)

Fixes

* During simulator initialization, trigger concurrent periodic and "right now" events (`#13438`_)
* VelocityImplicitEulerIntegrator resets cached matrices when user changes Jacobian scheme (`#13392`_)
* Luenberger observer uses cache entries instead of mutable member variables (`#13307`_)

Mathematical Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features

* TBD
* solvers: solvers: Skip compiled-but-unconfigured commercial solvers by default (`#13279`_)  # For Gurobi and Mosek, when their license key environment variable is unset, do not use them during ChooseBestSolver nor Solve. Previously, we would choose them only to immediately fail with a license server error message. It had been useful to fail-fast, but was increasingly difficult to manage. Given that the build-time choice must be project-wide, it forced projects to put the license server in their critical path even for real-time control queries that could as easily be solved with something fast and free like OSQP. By deferring the solver selection to runtime (checking the solver- specific license key environment variables already required by the third-party libraries), it still uses the solver when the license is configured but otherwise behaves as-if the solver was omitted. To retain the prior fail-fast behavior, users should set the env variable to either their default (server) value, or a non-empty invalid string literal.
* solvers: Allow using Binding<C> as key in unordered_map (`#13322`_)  # Allow using Binding<C> as key in unordered_map. Add operator==, operator!= and hash function for Binding<C>
* solvers: Get dual solution for OSQP solver (`#13347`_)
* solvers: Add parsing of string options to SNOPT (`#13397`_)
* solvers: Gurobi gets dual solution for QP and LP (`#13377`_)  # Gurobi returns dual solution for linear inequality/equality and bounding box constraints.
* solvers: Fix the CI failure for LPDualSolution1 (`#13404`_)
* solvers: Get dual solution for EqualityConstrainedQPSolver (`#13394`_)
* solvers: Add dual solution for IpoptSolver (`#13402`_)

Fixes

* TBD

Multibody Dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features

* TBD
* attic,geometry,systems: Deprecate the Isometry3 in systems/rendering (`#13327`_)  # - PoseBundle::{set|get)_pose deprecated; replaced with (set_)transform() - get_pose() no longer returns a reference to an Isometry3. - PoseVector::get_isometry deprecated; replaced with transform() - Also added set_transform() based on old TODO. - Multiple downstream consumers (and their tests) updated to use new API. - Bindings updated (with deprecations) and test - pose_bundle_to_draw_message_test

RenderEngineVtk is changed to be sub-classable - Copy constructor moved from private to protected. - Final designation has been removed. - It gives derived classes access to the actors. - Fixes a bug that previously went unnoticed; `SetDefaultLightPosition` didn't declare override of the virtual RenderEngine method. 3.
