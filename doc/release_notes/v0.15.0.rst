*************
Drake v0.15.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

This release includes a number of translations of consumers of the legacy
``RigidBodyTree`` simulator to the newer ``MultibodyPlant``, including every
example used by our MIT users.

A number of substitutes for what are now C++ standard library mechanisms have
completed their voyage through the deprecation pipeline; we bid farewell to
``drake_optional``, ``drake_variant``, and the Spruce filesystem library in this
release.


Breaking Changes
----------------

These are breaking changes that did not undergo a deprecation period.

* Removed some hydroelastic property setter methods:

  * Remove ``MultibodyPlant::set_elastic_modulus`` (`#12596`_)
  * Remove ``MultibodyPlant::set_hunt_crossley_dissipation`` (`#12596`_)
  * We believe this API, although public, has no downstream users.

* Hide ``filesystem.h`` from downstreams (`#12686`_)

  * We believe this API, although public, has no downstream users.

* Re-implement the uniformly random rotation to actually be uniform (`#12562`_)

  * This has caused some problems for consumers: The existing behaviour,
    although wrong, was relied on by some downstream code.

Dynamical Systems
-----------------

New features

* Support Gaussian initial conditions in Affine/Linear systems (`#12637`_)
* Enable ``math::ComputeNumericalGradient()`` for scalar types ``T != double`` (`#12629`_)

* All vector-gen sources are switched to yaml format (`#12684`_)

Fixes
