*************
Drake v0.25.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

* Drake no longer supports for macOS Mojave 10.14 (`#14352`_); it only
  supports Catalina 10.15.  Work is underway to support Big Sur 11.

Breaking changes since v0.24.0
------------------------------

* systems: Move spring_mass_system to a test utility (`#14284`_) This is a
  breaking change for anyone who was using this plant via the precompiled
  binaries.
* [proximity] Implement Mesh for proximity via its convex hull (`#14351`_)
  Anyone with a mesh registered with a proximity role will start observing
  proximity query results where there were none before.
* Replace robotlocomotion.robot_plan_t with drake.lcmt_robot_plan (`#14377`_)
  EncodeKeyFrames, MoveIkDemoBase, and RobotPlanInterpolator and their
  associated demos (move_iiwa_ee, move_jaco_rr, kuka_plan_runner, etc.), now
  operate on lcmt_robot_plan messages, not robot_plan_t
  messages. EncodeKeyFrames no longer takes an "info" argument -- the message
  no longer contains the unused snopt integer.
* Remove pydrake.common.cpp_const and pydrake.third_party (`#14270`_).

If the return value isn't *captured* (e.g. vis = DrakeVis.AddToBuilder(....)) then that keep alive won't work and the lcm can be subsequently destroyed. This has been observed in the wild.
