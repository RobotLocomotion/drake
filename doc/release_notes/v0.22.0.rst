TBD

Breaking changes since v0.21.0
------------------------------

* TBD Make set_default_positions an NVI (`#13757`_)
* TBD This maybe removed some files (`#13758`_)

Changes since v0.21.0:
----------------------

Dynamical Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

Mathematical Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features

* TBD Add examples on sum-of-squares (`#13719`_)
* TBD Add two more examples on SOS optimization (`#13746`_, `#13759`_, `#13765`_)
* TBD Fix a bug when customizing the quadratic cost (`#13752`_)
* TBD MPResult::GetSolution also works for a polynomial (`#13748`_)
* TBD Add symbolic ChebyshevPolynomial (`#13751`_)
* TBD Add GetKnownSolvers (`#13821`_)

Fixes

* TBD

Multibody Dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features

* TBD Implement PlanarMobilizer (`#13711`_)
* TBD Introduce discrete contact pairs for agnostic treatment of discrete contact models (`#13734`_)  # * Introduce discrete pairs in MBP so that TAMSI is agnostic to how pairs are collected. To be noted in the next release: In addition, this PR fixes and old TODO in the Jacobian computation and therefore contact results are expected to change so slightly (in the right direction). Not a breaking change, but probably users should be notified in the next release.
* TBD Make set_default_positions an NVI (`#13757`_)
* TBD Implement PlanarJoint (`#13747`_, `#13813`_)
* TBD Add support for parsing SDF and URDF from strings (`#13814`_)

Fixes

* TBD Fix format in TAMSIs exception message (`#13802`_)
* TBD Make contact results deterministic (`#13737`_)

Tutorials and examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use planar visualization in the ManipulationStation demos (`#13755`_)

Miscellaneous features and fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Reformat all XML files with xmllint (`#13768`_)
* Upgrade all models to use SDFormat 1.7 syntax (`#13772`_, `#13774`_, `#13758`_)
* yaml: Add YamlWriteArchive::EraseMatchingMaps (`#13699`_)

pydrake bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New features

* Redirect drake's logs to the Python ``logging`` module instead of stderr (`#13568`_, `#13781`_)

Fixes
