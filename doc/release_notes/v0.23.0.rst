*************
Drake v0.23.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

* TBD

Breaking changes since v0.22.0
------------------------------

* The drake::systems::Subvector and drake::systems::Supervector are now marked
  final (`#13907`_)
* For drake::yaml::YamlReadArchive, it's now an error for yaml data to remain
  unparsed, unless the user opts in to allowing it. Users who want a different
  behavior should change the Options at construction-time. (`#13900`_)
* The drake::examples::rod2d::Rod2D::pose_output() port has been removed, as
  the system no longer connects to the systems::rendering API (`#13890`_).

Notes
-----

This release provides `pre-compiled binaries
<https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v0.23.0>`__ named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{bionic|focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See :ref:`Nightly Releases
<nightly-releases>` for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of `SNOPT
<https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/>`__ as part of the
`Mathematical Program toolbox
<https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html>`__. Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
