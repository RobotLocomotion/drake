*************
Drake v0.23.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

* All code for RigidBodyPlant and the drake "attic" has been removed (`#13889`_).

Breaking changes since v0.22.0
------------------------------

These are breaking changes that did not undergo a deprecation period:

* The drake::systems::Subvector and drake::systems::Supervector are now marked
  final (`#13907`_)
* For drake::yaml::YamlReadArchive, it's now an error for yaml data to remain
  unparsed, unless the user opts in to allowing it. Users who want a different
  behavior should change the Options at construction-time. (`#13900`_)
* The drake::examples::rod2d::Rod2D::pose_output() port has been removed, as
  the system no longer connects to the systems::rendering API (`#13890`_).
