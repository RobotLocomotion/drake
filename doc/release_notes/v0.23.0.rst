Drake v0.23.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

* TBD

Breaking changes since v0.22.0
------------------------------

* The drake::systems::Subvector and drake::systems::Supervector are now marked
  final (`#13907`_)
* For drake::yaml::YamlReadArchive, it's now an error for yaml data to remain
  unparsed, unless the user opts in to allowing it. Users who want a different
  behavior should change the Options at construction-time. (`#13900`_)
* The drake::examples::rod2d::Rod2D::pose_output() port has been removed, as
  the system no longer connects to the systems::rendering API (`#13890`_).

Changes since v0.22.0

Dynamical Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for systems go here>

New features

* Mark Subvector and Supervector final (`#13907`_)

Mathematical Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for solvers go here>

New features

Fixes

* TBD

Multibody Dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here>
* TBD Implement Frame::CalcSpatialAccelerationInWorld() (`#13773`_)  # Implement Frame::CalcSpatialAccelerationInWorld()
* TBD Consolidate code to be used for both bias and regular (unbias) spatial accelerations (`#13838`_)
* TBD Move acceleration cache from plant to tree system (`#13873`_)
* TBD multibody: Support parsing massless bodies (`#13908`_, `#13927`_)  # * Support parsing massless bodies from SDF and URDF
* TBD Geometry support for discrete hydroelastic contact (`#13864`_)  # 1. Introduce new (optional) data for ContactSurface. The gradients of the constituent fields sampled once per *triangle*. 2. Extend API to allow for addition of new data in results. - HydroelasticCallback - Soft-rigid mesh intersection - rigid half space-soft mesh intersection - soft half space-rigid mesh intersection 3. Incidentally cleaned up some unit test issues in related code.
* TBD Implements a LinearOperator class to be used by contact solvers (`#13911`_)
* TBD Reduce heap allocation in CalcMassMatrix() (`#13928`_)  # * Cache composite body inertias to eliminate temp allocation in CalcMassMatrix(). Modernize cache allocation code.
* TBD Eliminate remaining heap use from CalcMassMatrix() (`#13933`_, `#13953`_)  # * Eliminate the rest of the heap allocations in CalcMassMatrix. Add and use SpatialForce::ShiftInPlace() method.

* TBD Revert "Add jupyter widget version of JointSliders" (`#13901`_)  # This reverts commit 706fedc18f7c440815bb7e60d1b235614a56e3e9.
* TBD Adds missing import for jupyter widgets (`#13941`_)  # * Adds missing import for jupyter (was somehow not needed in most cases, but mac nbconvert seemed to miss it.  go figure)
