*************
Drake v0.13.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

* Drake's `tutorials`_ continue to improve, now including:

  * Rendering that uses MultibodyPlant (`#12388`_)
  * Optimization using MultibodyPlant, focused on custom evaluators (`#12433`_, `#12443`_)

* Users who compile Drake from source as a bazel external (as in the `drake_bazel_external`_ pattern) should no longer set ``build --incompatible_remove_legacy_whole_archive=false`` in their projectâ€™s ``.bazelrc`` (`#12262`_)

Breaking Changes
----------------

These are breaking changes that did not undergo a deprecation period:

* Remove all Bazel machinery for protobuf message generation (`#12450`_)
* Remove drake::systems::EventCollection::Merge (`#12357`_)

Dynamical Systems
-----------------

New features

* Usability improvements to SymbolicVectorSystem:

  * Add LinearizeDynamics (`#12466`_)
  * Add dynamics_for_variable (`#12421`_)
  * The setters for state, input, parameter, dynamics, and output offer a std::vector overload, so that a user can write ``.dynamics({-x_[1], -x_[0] + 3})``  (`#12421`_)

Fixes

* Better error message when cloning a non-root Context (`#12391`_)
* Improve documentation on integrators (`#12350`_, `#12392`_)
* Improve documentation on the use of accuracy in the Context (`#12428`_)

Mathematical Program
--------------------

New features

* Add MathematicalProgram::indeterminates_index (`#12405`_)
* Add drake::Evaluate for symbolic SparseMatrix (`#12406`_)
* Add matrix version of drake::symbolic::Environment::insert (`#12409`_)

Fixes

* Speed up symbolic::Polynomial::decision_variables by storing indeterminates and decision variables as members (`#11790`_)
* Fix Eigen::SparseMatrix memory leak related to drake::symbolic::Expression (`#12459`_)

Multibody Dynamics
------------------

New features
Fixes

* TBD Update stale instructions on subclassing Shape specification (`#12372`_)
* TBD Rename/simplify/reword MultibodyTreeElement to produce better doxygen (`#12352`_)
* TBD Simplify and deprecate ``get_`` accessors in shape specification API (`#12373`_)
* TBD Adds a query for signed distance between a single pair of geometries (`#12379`_)  # QueryObject has a new method. It attempts to produce a signed distance pair result between a user-specified pair of geometries.
* TBD Add sdf parsing for ellipsoids (`#12324`_)
* TBD geometry: create ellipsoid meshes (`#12323`_)
* TBD geometry: export volume and surface meshes and fields to VTK files (`#12311`_)
* TBD geometry: create pressure fields for ellipsoids and spheres in hydroelastic contact models (`#12333`_)
* TBD geometry: pressure fields in cylinders for hydroelastic contact model (`#12348`_)
* TBD geometry: enable soft/rigid sphere, box, cylinder, and ellipsoid in hydroelastic contact model (`#12358`_)
* TBD geometry: document QueryObject::ComputeContactSurfaces() (`#12413`_)
* TBD geometry: support rigid Mesh in ComputeContactSurfaces for hydroelastic (`#12455`_)  # It is for hydroelastic contact model. Mesh is not supported in other proximity queries, mostly because we cannot use FCL's mesh representation, which is a triangle soup without the concept of enclosing volume. However, we still need broadphase culling for Mesh geometries colliding with other geometries. Therefore, we have colliding trees of bounding boxes of Mesh separated from the trees of other geometries.
* TBD Add BoundingVolumeHierarchy class (`#12347`_)  # - add RigidMesh struct layer to hold the bvh, similar to the SoftMesh struct layer - create AABB tree with first pass on splitting branches based on axis spread, optimisations to come
* TBD Support collision queries with capsule (`#12343`_)
* TBD Tests for capsule support for distance to shape in proximity engine (`#12332`_)
* TBD Removed referring triangles from SurfaceMesh (`#12438`_)
* TBD Hydroelastic spatial force visualization (`#12378`_)  # Adds the ability to visualize spatial forces (force and moment) to drake visualizer.
* TBD Removing grad_H from ContactSurface (`#12432`_)  # We are no longer using the grad_h value to define the normal of the contact surface. Instead, we're using the triangle normals of the surface itself. So, we remove the field and change downstream references to use the face normal instead. This act revealed some imprecision in the documented and implemented behaviors of the triangle normals. Where appropriate new documentation has been added (and tested) to help clarify the expectations of normals.
* TBD fix show_hydroelastic_contact plugin of drake_visualizer (`#12417`_)
* TBD Added new generalized acceleration ports (`#12354`_)
* TBD Reverses the surface normal convention in ContactSurface (`#12463`_)
* TBD Documents forward dynamics algorithm and notation in MBT (`#12317`_)
* TBD Reorder and regroup MBPlant API (`#12342`_)
* TBD Provide access to owning MBPlant from any MBElement (`#12380`_)
* TBD Change MBP's TAMSI solver success assertion into an exception (`#12361`_)  # with a detailed description of possible causes/actions.
* TBD Implements ABA forward dynamics (`#12412`_)
* TBD Fixes qdot-to-v mapping (and back) for discrete MultibodyPlant (`#12355`_)
* TBD Adds missing operators to SpatialVector (`#12436`_)
* TBD Make effective use of SpatialAcceleration's addition operators (`#12462`_)
* TBD Improve RollPitchYaw and RotationMatrix class documentation (#12345) (`#12345`_)
