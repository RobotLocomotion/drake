*************
Drake v0.26.0
*************

Announcements
-------------

* None

Breaking changes since v0.25.0
------------------------------

* Downgrade the spdlog external to release 5.1.0 and fmt external to release 6.1.2 (`#14427`_).
* FixInputPort and DeclareAbstractState no longer allow for mutation through an alias (`#14453`_).
* Remove support for the add_package_path stanza in multibody parsing model directives  (`#14529`_).

Changes since v0.25.0
---------------------

Dynamical Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for systems go here>

New features

* Add PiecewisePoseTrajectory (`#14337`_, `#14503`_)
* PidControlledSystem takes in user specified plant input port (`#14490`_)

Fixes

* None

Mathematical Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for solvers go here>

New features

* Retrieve dual solution for conic constraint in Mosek (`#14383`_)
* Allow for incomplete symbolic derivatives (`#14514`_)

Fixes

* None

Multibody Dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here>

* TBD multibody: Give better errors when joints overlap with SDF static welds (`#14534`_)  # Closes #14518. Indicate SDF-inserted welds by using an elaborate joint name. Since this defeats the fail-fast error induced by having duplicate joint names (for redundant welds), implement a more robust fail-fast error that complains about any two joints that connect the same two bodies, regardless of direction or other details.
New features

* Add MultibodyPlant::CalcCenterOfMassTranslationalVelocityInWorld (`#14297`_)
* Add MultibodyPlant::GetUniqueBaseBody and MultibodyPlant::HasUniqueFreeBaseBody (`#14450`_)
* New hydroelastic contact model in progress (`#14506`_, `#14469`_)

Fixes

* None

Tutorials and examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here>

* TBD [examples,geometry,manipulation,multibody] Use DrakeVisualizerd instead of DrakeVisualizer (`#14547`_)  # In the future PR we will templatize DrakeVisualizer class.  This PR makes sure the code doesn't break, and is compatible with the future templated DrakeVisualizer class. Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* Add example of monte carlo simulation using acrobot (`#14522`_)

Miscellaneous features and fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here>

* Add MeshcatVisualizer option to draw collision geometry (`#14467`_)

pydrake bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for bindings go here>

New features

* System diagrams now appear in the Sphinx documentation (`#14500`_)

Fixes

* None

Newly bound

* None

Build system and dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for attic,cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here>

* Downgrade fmt to release 6.1.2 (`#14427`_)
* Downgrade spdlog to release 5.1.0 (`#14427`_)
* Upgrade fcl to latest commit (`#14497`_)
* Upgrade ghc_filesystem to latest release 1.4.0 (`#14504`_)

* Upgrade optitrack_driver to latest commit (`#14451`_)
* Allow sphinx-build to be missing during bazel fetch (`#14528`_)
* Add dependency on TRI common_robotics_utilities; for now this is only used by test code, but in a future release will be used by a forthcoming new drake/planning/... library (`#14437`_, `#14530`_)
* Add dependency on TRI voxelized_geometry_tools ; for now this is only used by test code, but in a future release will be used by a forthcoming new drake/planning/... library (`#14437`_, `#14530`_)

Changes specific to macOS:

* Use fmt and spdlog from homebrew (`#14517`_, `#14427`_)

Changes specific to Ubuntu:

* On 20.04, use fmt and spdlog from Ubuntu's apt package (`#14427`_)

Newly-deprecated APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* drake::systems::ContextBase::FixInputPort with AbstractValue unique_ptr (`#14453`_)
* drake::systems::LeafSystem::DeclareAbstractState with AbstractValue unique_ptr (`#14453`_)
* drake::manipulation::PiecewiseCubicTrajectory (`#14337`_)
* drake::manipulation::PiecewiseCartesianTrajectory (`#14337`_)
* drake::systems::framework::Diagram::get_input_port_locator (`#14361`_)

  * This was actually deprecated in v0.25.0, but the initial announcement for that release forgot to list it.

* The ability for MeshcatVisualizer to use a pose_bundle input port (`#14292`_)

  * This was actually deprecated in v0.25.0, but the initial announcement for that release forgot to list it.
