Changes since v0.25.0
---------------------

Dynamical Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for systems go here>

[systems,manipulation,examples,geometry] * TBD systems: Use const-ref arguments, not unique_ptr (`#14453`_)  # This commit changes FixInputPort and DeclareAbstractState to require pass-by-value (the unique_ptr overloads are deprecated). These two now-deprecated functions ... - ContextBase::FixInputPort(int, std::unique_ptr<AbstractValue>) - LeafSystem::DeclareAbstractState(std::unique_ptr<AbstractValue>) ... now clone the argument, instead of moving it.  Calling code that relied on retaining an alias into the transferred storage will now end up with a dangling pointer.  This is a breaking change for any code that relied on such aliasing.
* TBD PidControlledSystem takes in user specified plant input port (`#14490`_)

New features

* TBD

Fixes

Mathematical Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for solvers go here>

[solvers,tools,doc] * TBD upgrade mosek to mosek 9.2 (`#14484`_)  # * upgrade mosek to mosek 92
* TBD Retrieve dual solution for conic constraint in Mosek (`#14383`_)

Multibody Dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here>

* TBD Methods, documentation, and tests for CalcCenterOfMassTranslationalVelocityInWorld() (`#14297`_)
* TBD [geometry] This PR prepare for next PR "Make Cylinder mesh with medial axis." (`#14421`_)  # Utilities for mesh generation: SplitTriangularPrismToTetrahedra() and SplitPyramidToTetrahedra().
* TBD  Change /// to // within internal namespace within multibody_tree.h to address part of issue #13738 (`#14459`_)
* TBD Change /// to // within internal namespace in mobilizer.h (`#14461`_)  # Co-authored-by: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* TBD Change /// to // for internal namespace in commonly-encountered header files (`#14468`_)
* TBD [geometry] Documentation of MeshFieldLinear() about (`#14460`_)  # calculate_gradient parameter. (#14460)
* TBD [geometry,tools] tools: Move cc macros for per_os support to common skylark (`#14471`_)
* TBD [multibody,math,common] In .h files within internal namespace, change /// and /** to // and /* to resolve issue #13738 (`#14474`_)
* TBD mutlibody_plant: Convert class overview to javadoc (`#14499`_)  # * multibody_plant: Convert class overview to javadoc
* TBD [geometry] Make Cylinder's tetrahedral mesh with medial axis (`#14469`_)
* TBD [multibody,examples] Implement MBP::GetUniqueBaseBody() (`#14450`_)  # * Implement MBP::GetUniqueFreeBaseBodyOrThrow() In addition, implement MBP::HasUniqueFreeBaseBody(). Fix #9747. Resolve the third item in #10736.
* TBD [geometry] Use Cylinder's meshes with medial axes in hydroelastics (`#14506`_)
* TBD multibody: Remove add_package_path from model directives (`#14529`_)  # Package URIs are controlled by PackageMap, not in-band directives. This is a breaking change.

Tutorials and examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here>

* TBD Move acrobot monte carlo simulation out of dev (`#14522`_)  # * Toward #13904 * This is the infrastructure to run monte carlo simulations of the acrobot under Spong control. * This is an example of how to use the stochastic schema mechanism for monte carlo testing * A subsequent PR will bring in an example of using this along with an optimizer to learn controller parameters (that code remains in dev in this PR)
* TBD

Miscellaneous features and fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here>

[manipulation,systems] * TBD doxygen: add @ingroup tags to schunk wsg systems (`#14412`_)
[math,systems,tools,multibody,geometry,setup] * TBD Remove deprecated code 2021-01 (`#14486`_)
* TBD schema: Correct stddev comments (`#14494`_)

* TBD Hotfix to repair build failure caused by #14337 (`#14503`_)
* TBD Allow incomplete derivatives, signaling with NaN at evaluation-time where possible (`#14514`_)  # * Addresses #8648 (full resolution pends on adding a Discontinuities() accessor to Formula or similar)
* TBD

Build system and dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
