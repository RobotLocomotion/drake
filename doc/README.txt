Tools for debugging client-side (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):

All server-side concepts are those supported by Jekyll:

* [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), which uses:
    * [Liquid Templating Language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/)
    * [Kramdown Flavor of Markdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html)
* Nuances: <https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/orderofinterpretation/>

# Caveats

## Using Markdown in HTML tags

Kramdown has the useful feature of being able to use the attribute
`@markdown="1"`. However, it can make things a little weird with indentation,
so be careful and preview often!

For more information: <https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#html-blocks>

## Table of Contents

There are some solutions to generating TOC's, with some drawbacks:

### Use Kramdown's `{:toc}` feature.

This is what we use. However, due the
[order in which Jekyll parses things](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/orderofinterpretation/),
we cannot automagically "surround" page contents without doing so explicitly.

However, it's not that bad. `:shrug:`

Here's an example patch of adding TOC to a page:

```patch
diff --git a/example.md b/example.md
index f33a459..51ba7a4 100644
--- a/example.md
+++ b/example.md
@@ -1,7 +1,11 @@

```

### Use another plugin

* <https://github.com/allejo/jekyll-toc> is neat, but does some Liquid+Jekyll (and Ruby?) voodoo. Nah for now, maybe later.
    * FWIW They cite the need to repeat stuff as a pain point, so duly noted.
* <https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc> is a Ruby gem, but has a lot of
logic. Nah for now, maybe later too.
