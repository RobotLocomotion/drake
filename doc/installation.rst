Installation and Quickstart
***************************


Previewing
==========

Before installing, you can preview the Python functionality of Drake by using
Binder:

.. raw:: html

    <a target="_doc" href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RobotLocomotion/drake/nightly-release?filepath=tutorials">
      <img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg"/>
    </a>

As you are exploring, you should also review
:ref:`What's Available from Python <whats-available-from-python>`.

Choose an installation method
=============================

You can choose to download a pre-compiled version of Drake, or to build it from source.  The pre-compiled versions are much easier to use, but the source version is easier to update and will make it easier for you to contribute your fixes/improvements.
