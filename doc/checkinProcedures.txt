This document defines the requirements that must be met before anything 
is committed to the main branch of the robotlib repository.

Unit tests
  Whenever possible, add test files (in any subdirectory test) any code 
  that you have added or modified.  These take a little time initially, 
  but can save incredible amounts of time later.

Run all tests
  Before committing anything to the repository, the code must pass all of 
  the unit tests.  Use the following script to check:
    robotlib/runAllTests.m 

Matlab Reports
  There are a number of helpful matlab reports, that can be run using: 
    Desktop>Current Directory,
  then 
    Action>Reports  (the Action menu is the gear icon)

  Before a commit, your code should pass the following reports:
    Contents report
    Help report  (with all but the Copyright options checked)
  And you should run the M-Link Code Check report to look for useful suggestions.
