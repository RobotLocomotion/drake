In order to fork a copy (branch) of robotlib, e.g. for development,  you probably want to be careful to unset the property which emails the entire locomotion group on every commit.  Use the following commands:

cd into your /locomotion directory
svn cp robotlib robotlib-mydev
svn propdel -R rlg:email robotlib-mydev 
svn commit robotlib-mydev

where "robotlib-mydev" can be replaced with whatever you'd like to call your local copy. 

And you probably want to edit /afs/csail.mit.edu/group/locomotion/repository/conf/dav.conf to have an entry

[/robotlib-mydev]
@mylab = 
your_svn_name = rw
scriptuser = r
