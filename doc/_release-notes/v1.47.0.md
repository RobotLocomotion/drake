date: 2025-11-17
released: 2025-11-17

# Announcements

* Drake now offers build flags to opt-out of compiling render engines
  ([#23574][_#23574]).
  * For CMake, the new flags are `WITH_RENDER_GL`,
    `WITH_RENDER_GLTF_CLIENT`, and
    `WITH_RENDER_VTK`.
  * For Bazel, the new flags are `--@drake//tools/flags:with_render_gl`,
    `--@drake//tools/flags:with_render_gltf_client`, and
    `--@drake//tools/flags:with_render_vtk`.
* Drake's macOS binary packages (`*.tar.gz`) now use Python 3.14
  ([#23655][_#23655]).
* Drake no longer provides macOS 3.12 wheels ([#23729][_#23729]).
* Update gurobi to 12.0.3. This may require users to update their Gurobi installation.
