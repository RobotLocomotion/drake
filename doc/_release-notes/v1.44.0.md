title: Drake v1.44.0
date: 2025-08-15
released: 2025-08-15
---

# Announcements

* We've added a new tutorial on automatic differentiation basics ([#23162][_#23162]).
* Wheel packages now depend on Mosek as a PyPI requirement instead of embedding
  it inside the Drake wheel file ([#23128][_#23128], [#23243][_#23243]).
  * Mosek packages declare an upper-bound on their supported Python version
    (<3.14); your package manager (e.g., Poetry) might require you to add
    that same bound in your `pyproject.toml` as a consequence.
  * Known issue: macOS wheels have incorrect RECORD checksums in this release;
    this will be fixed in v1.45.0.

# Breaking changes since v1.43.0

* The return type of `Joint::ordinal()` changed from `int` to `JointOrdinal`
  ([#23214][_#23214]).
  * However, the `JointOrdinal` class has an implicit conversion to `int`, so
    typical places where `joint.ordinal()` is used as an index should work
    without any adjustments. More complicated uses may need small adjustments
    to force the conversion to `int`.
* The type of `IrisFromCliqueCoverOptions.iris_options` has changed from
  `IrisOptions` to a sum type of `Union[IrisOptions | IrisNp2Options |
  IrisZoOptions]` ([#23104][_#23104]).
  * Users who set or get these options may need to adapt their code to be more
    specific about which of the three options classes should be used.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Notes

This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.44.0) named
``drake-1.44.0-{jammy|noble|mac-arm64}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
