* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [fix] TBD SchunkWsgTrajectoryGenerator should reset trajectory_ based on context ([#23196][_#23196])  # Set the initial trajectory_start_time to infinity in the state vector.
* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade python venv (mac) to latest ([#23231][_#23231])
* [fix] TBD [tools,setup] [tools] Use mold linker on Linux Noble debug builds ([#22951][_#22951])

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [workspace,tools,solvers,doc] Lazy load MOSEK in wheel ([#23128][_#23128])  # Use Implib.so to generate a lazy-load trampoline for MOSEK. Use this when building wheels to allow MOSEK to be lazy-loaded rather than loaded on startup. This will also allow us to not ship MOSEK with Drake itself.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade abseil_cpp_internal to latest commit ([#23228][_#23228])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade drake_models to latest commit ([#23228][_#23228])

* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade mujoco_menagerie_internal to latest commit ([#23228][_#23228])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade mypy_internal to latest release v1.17.0 ([#23228][_#23228])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade stable_baselines3_internal to latest release v2.7.0 ([#23228][_#23228])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade suitesparse_internal to latest release v7.11.0 ([#23228][_#23228])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade tinyobjloader_internal to latest commit ([#23228][_#23228])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade typing_extensions_internal to latest release 4.14.1 ([#23228][_#23228])
* [fix] TBD [workspace,tools] [workspace] Upgrade crate_universe to latest ([#23228][_#23228])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade curl_internal to latest release 8.15.0 ([#23229][_#23229])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade gklib_internal to latest commit ([#23230][_#23230])
