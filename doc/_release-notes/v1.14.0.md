# Changes since v1.13.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Improve defaults for AffineSystem and LinearSystem ([#18822][_#18822])
* [newly deprecated] TBD [systems,examples] Clean up ZMPPlanner ([#18845][_#18845])  # Originally inspired by observed errors in doxygen formatting (erroneous comments in `@param foo, bar` led to incorrect documentation). However, the clean up expanded to the following: 1. Correct the doxygen formatting error. 2. Update doxygen to use the current practice of /** */ comments without leading * on each line. 3. References to other methods include terminal (). 4. Add `@pre` to functions that require `Plan()` to have been called. 5. Rename the class to conform with current standards.
* [removal of deprecated] TBD [systems,multibody,common] Remove 2023-03 deprecations ([#18927][_#18927])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [solvers,multibody,tools] [solvers] Add GUROBI_NUM_THREADS environment variable ([#18819][_#18819])
* [newly deprecated] TBD [solvers] Change SolverBase constructor to prefer SolverId directly ([#18880][_#18880])  # The constructor with a SolverId-returning functor is now deprecated. Fetching the solver_id() should be a zero-cost abstraction, which means the function must be final and inline, rather than a virtual function that makes another indirect call. Add an API comment and runtime warning about SolverId pessimizations. The SolverId is supposed to be a integer-like flyweight that's cheap to pass by value, but when its name exceeds 15 characters (i.e., more than SSO can handle) then we were using heap when copying it (e.g., into the SolverOptions maps). While we're updating comments anyway, upgrade them all to the preferred lightweight Doxygen style.
* [fix] TBD [solvers] Remove redundant options copying in IpoptSolver ([#18874][_#18874])  # Note the contract of SolverBase::DoSolve: The options and initial guess are already merged, i.e., the DoSolve implementation should ignore prog's solver options and guess. Removing the extra copying should be a performance speed-up.
* [fix] TBD [solvers] Fix a bug in GurobiSolver with duplicated variables in second-order cone constraints ([#18890][_#18890])
* [fix] TBD [solvers] retrieve Mosek IPM solution if basis selection is disabled for LP ([#18895][_#18895])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [multibody,geometry] Allow models to be parsed into plant from obj files ([#18776][_#18776])
* [fix] TBD Ignore collision filter groups from model directives if there's no scene graph ([#18798][_#18798])
* [feature] TBD [geometry,common,multibody,systems,solvers,examples,manipulation,planning,math,perception] Add fmt_eigen and use throughout for logging and errors ([#18811][_#18811])
* [breaking change fix] TBD const InverseKinematics no longer gives mutable access to members ([#18793][_#18793])  # The get_mutable_prog() was mistakenly tagged as const.
* [feature] TBD [Inverse Kinematics] Add PointToLineDistanceConstraint ([#18817][_#18817])
* [feature] TBD [C-IRIS] move c_iris_collision_geometry out of dev folder ([#18824][_#18824])
* [feature] TBD [C-IRIS] move c_iris_separating_plane out of dev ([#18852][_#18852])  # We define how to compute the separating plane as polynomial of configuration variable s.
* [feature] TBD [C-IRIS] move cspace_free_polytope.h out of dev folder ([#18860][_#18860])  # I will move the cc file out of dev folder in my next PR.
* [feature] TBD Add SpatialInertia::PointMass() ([#18864][_#18864])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD [C-IRIS] move CspaceFreePolytope constructor out of dev folder ([#18863][_#18863])
* [feature] TBD Add SpatialInertial::HollowSphereWithDensity() ([#18865][_#18865])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD Add SpatialInertia::SolidCubeWithDensity() ([#18866][_#18866])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD Add SpatialInertia::SolidCylinderAboutEnd() ([#18889][_#18889])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD SceneGraphInspector provides ordering guarantees on reported ids ([#18903][_#18903])  # SceneGraphInspector has four methods that return collections of ids (frame and geometry). Previously, only one of those guaranteed ordering on the ids. This brings the other three in line.
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [multibody,planning,manipulation] [multibody] Add ScopedName as a first-class citizen ([#17482][_#17482])  # Deprecate a bunch of helper functions from scoped_names.h.
* [fix] TBD [parsing] Relax single model test in SDFormat singular API ([#18888][_#18888])  # The SDFormat API has evolved since the original check was written. Work harder to tolerate single-model loading within the richer API. Long term, we aim to drop single-model enforcing APIs altogether.
* [feature] TBD [parsing] Support auto-renaming of models ([#18921][_#18921])  # Add a parser option {Set,Get}AutoRenaming(bool). When enabled, the parser will resolve model naming conflicts by adding a numeric subscript to names. This is another step in the long march toward retiring Parser APIs that assume and/or enforce single-model-per-input-text conditions.
* [newly deprecated fix] TBD [visualization] Fix model_visualizer reloading ([#18933][_#18933])  # Previously, after pushing the reload button it would vanish along with the stop button. The new control flow logic is less brittle and will be easier to maintain over time.
* [feature] TBD Add SpatialInertia::ThinRodWithMass() ([#18891][_#18891])

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [planning,multibody] [planning] Further improve welded body check ([#18723][_#18723])  # Improve check for welded bodies to use only a single call to FindSubgraphsOfWeldedBodies.

New features

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [tutorials] Adds an example of using `namedview` in authoring leaf systems ([#18809][_#18809])
* [feature] TBD [tutorials,planning] Add Diagram tutorial ([#18873][_#18873])
* [fix] TBD [examples,workspace] Fixes skydio model prop colors and normals ([#18867][_#18867])
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [common,workspace] [common] Add infrastructure for fmt without ostreams ([#18771][_#18771])  # Move drake::fmt_runtime shim from common/text_logging.h to new file common/fmt.h. Add DRAKE_FORMATTER_AS macro to trampoline formatter to another related object. This is useful for formatting wrapper types. Patch googletest to use fmt for formatting, when available. Port copyable_unique_ptr to the new code and deprecate its operator<<.
* [feature] TBD Add SubstituteAndExpand method to Polynomial ([#18752][_#18752])  # Add a method for substituting the indeterminates of a polynomial with new polynomial expressions and expanding the new polynomial in the monomial basis. This method is more efficient than calling Substitute and Expand separately.
* [feature] TBD [common,math,multibody] [common] Add infrastructure to opt-in to fmt via ostream ([#18801][_#18801])
* [fix] TBD Move the distal geometry for the Jaco arm to link 7 ([#18799][_#18799])
* [feature] TBD [common,solvers,geometry,multibody,systems,perception,workspace,math] Add formatter specializations throughout the codebase ([#18806][_#18806])  # Most are legacy fmt::ostream_formatters for now (with a TODO), though a few can use DRAKE_FORMATTER_AS.
* [fix] TBD [py symbolic] Enable matrix inversions ([#18823][_#18823])  # expression_matrix_test: - Show that statically-sized matrices must be used - Show that 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 work, but it fails for 5x5 - Add more explicit testing for numeric Expression matrices Reflect C++ behavior onto Python
* [feature] TBD [lcm,systems] [lcm] Add SubscribeMultichannel ([#18826][_#18826])
* [feature] TBD [lcm] Add DrakeLcmBase ([#18847][_#18847])  # This might smooth out downstream transitions for subclasses of DrakeLcmInterface.
* [fix] TBD [common,multibody,geometry,examples,tools,solvers,systems,workspace,math,perception] [workspace] Remove opt-in to FMT_DEPRECATED_OSTREAM ([#18850][_#18850])  # Drake is natively compatible with fmt v9 now. This reverts commit 33a33485 and 7c44c7e2. Remove all mentions of <fmt/ostream.h> except where it is actually used in earnest. Add a few formatters missed in prior commits.
* [newly deprecated] TBD [common,math,solvers,multibody] [common] Deprecate unused constants and typedefs in :essential ([#18857][_#18857])
* [feature] TBD [common,math] Adds BezierCurve (isa Trajectory) ([#18868][_#18868])  # This is related to, but distinct from, BsplineTrajectory (and much simpler). It plays an important role in our Graph of Convex Sets motion planning.
* [fix] TBD [symbolic] Speed up Add and Mul cell ctors ([#18869][_#18869])
* [newly deprecated] TBD [common] Deprecate SortedPair::operator<< ([#18892][_#18892])
* [fix] TBD [symbolic] Speed up symbolic::Variable a little bit ([#18901][_#18901])  # Pack the Variable::Type into the ID. This reduces sizeof(Variable) from 32 to 24 bytes. This is about a 2-3% speedup on BenchmarkPolynomialEvaluatePartial, but the main benefit is a step towards a size of 16 bytes with SSO in a future commit. This changes the order of variables in ordered collections. Previously, they were sorted by creation time. Now they're effectively sorted by the pair of (variable type, creation time).
* [feature] TBD [visualization] Add contact visualization to meshcat defaults ([#18907][_#18907])
* [feature] TBD [yaml] Serializable objects can also be output as JSON ([#18943][_#18943])
* [fix] TBD [manipulation,examples,multibody,workspace,tools] [install] Add and use drake_models/package.xml ([#18919][_#18919])  # Instead of installing RobotLocomotion/models meshes as-if they were copied into the Drake source tree, rather install them as a separate ROS package.xml. This is precursor work to fetching them at runtime instead of installing them at all.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [pydrake] Leave C++ logging sink intact (but no-op) ([#18750][_#18750])
* [feature] TBD [visualization] Meldis displays point cloud data ([#18896][_#18896])  # This commit is a re-apply of a6e371dc with some comment fixes.
* [newly deprecated] TBD [py plant] Deprecate CalcJacobianSpatialVelocity(*, p_BP) ([#18876][_#18876])  # Use `p_BoBp_B` for better consistency.
