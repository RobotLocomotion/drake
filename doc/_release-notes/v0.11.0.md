# Announcements

This is the final release that will support Python 2, C++14, Ubuntu 16.04, or macOS High Sierra. Future releases will require Python 3, C++17, and one of either Ubuntu 18.04 or macOS Mojave (or newer). See [#10606][_#10606] for details.

# Changes since v0.10.0

## Dynamical Systems

* New [tutorial for systems framework](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/tutorials/dynamical_systems.ipynb) ([#12009][_#12009], [#12045][_#12045])
* Implicit Euler integrator improves convergence speed ([#12018][_#12018])
* ``SymbolicVectorSystem`` adds parameters and accessors ([#12012][_#12012], [#12048][_#12048])
* Fix: Graphviz output for diagram port names ([#12060][_#12060])

## Mathematical Program

* New [tutorial for mathematical program](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/tutorials/mathematical_program.ipynb) ([#12023][_#12023], [#12032][_#12032])
* Developers can now implement ``SolverInterface`` subclasses in pydrake ([#12056][_#12056])
* Add constructors of ``MultipleShooting`` that accept placeholders ([#12051][_#12051])
* Add alias ``solvers::DecisionVariable`` for ``symbolic::Variable`` ([#12051][_#12051])
* Improve SNOPT citations and credits ([#12062][_#12062])

## Multibody Dynamics

* New hydroelastic contact model in progress ([#11924][_#11924], [#11928][_#11928], [#11986][_#11986], [#11996][_#11996], [#12029][_#12029], [#12036][_#12036], [#12082][_#12082], [#12083][_#12083], [#12085][_#12085], [#12093][_#12093], [#12094][_#12094], [#12096][_#12096], [#12100][_#12100], [#12101][_#12101], [#12103][_#12103], [#12112][_#12112])
  * This is experimental and will change in the near future! (And it will not be used by default.)
  * Hydroelastics only supports soft-hard contact with spheres; see demo at ``examples/multibody/rolling_sphere``.
  * For more information, see Elandt, et al. “A pressure field model for fast, robust approximation of net contact force and moment between nominally rigid objects” to appear in IROS 2019. [ArXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11433).
* Add ``ContactResults`` output for continuous plant (previously, only discrete) ([#12067][_#12067])
* Fix: Gravity generalized forces must ignore velocity terms ([#12065][_#12065])
* Fix: Contact force direction appears to be incorrect ([#12067][_#12067])
* Fix: Crash when there are no degrees of freedom ([#12070][_#12070])
* Cache generalized accelerations for both continuous and discrete models ([#12050][_#12050])
