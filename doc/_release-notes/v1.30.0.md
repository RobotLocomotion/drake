title: Drake v1.30.0
date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* Drake now officially supports Ubuntu 24.04 ("Noble Numbat").
  * Refer to [OS Support](/stable.html#os-support) for background about our
    support timelines.
* ``SceneGraph`` now accepts and uses a ``SceneGraphConfig`` ([#21366][_#21366])
  * This enables setting default values for proximity properties (e.g.,
    ``hunt_crossley_dissipation``) that will be used in the absence of more
    specific properties given in model files being loaded.
  * Most importantly, users can set the default value for ``compliance_type``
    to `"compliant"` to use compliant-hydroelastic contact throughout the scene,
    without editing existing model files.
* OsqpSolver runs in deterministic mode by default ([#21434][_#21434])
  * Users who wish to keep using "adaptive rho" can set the solver option
    ``adaptive_rho_interval=0`` to restore the prior behavior.
* macOS uses Accelerate for BLAS/LAPACK instead of OpenBLAS ([#21135][_#21135])
  * This follows in the footsteps of ``numpy`` and ``scipy``, which have
    investigated and demonstrated that Accelerate is now the best choice.

# Breaking changes since v1.29.0

* Multibody vector methods that operate in place (i.e., with ``InPlace`` in
  their method name) no longer return ``*this`` ([#21438][_#21438]).
  * The classes with affect methods are: articulated body inertia, rotational
    inertia, spatial acceleration, spatial force, spatial inertia, spatial
    momentum, spatial velocity, unit inertia.
  * Using the return value was actually *worse* for performance, defeating the
    purpose of the efficient in-place mutation.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Changes since v1.29.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* None

Fixes

* None

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [solvers,planning] Lower bound in GcsTrajectoryOptimization subspace constraint should be -inf ([#21384][_#21384])  # In two steps: * Fix the underlying bug in graph_of_convex_sets.cc, revealing the bug present in gcs_trajectory_optimization.cc. * Fix the typo in gcs_trajectory_optimization.cc.
* [feature] TBD Mute Gurobi's warning on small coefficients ([#21540][_#21540])  # Gurobi throws warning if the coefficients is less than 1E-13. We check the coefficients of our problem data, and do not add the coefficient entry if it is smaller than 1E-13.
New features

* MathematicalProgram supports parsing symbolic L2 norm costs ([#21394][_#21394])
* CsdpSolver obeys SolverOptions ([#21449][_#21449])
* IpoptSolver uses the sparsity parttern of the constraints ([#21492][_#21492], [#21499][_#21499])

Fixes

* Speed up affine hull computation ([#21525][_#21525])
* OsqpSolver runs in deterministic mode by default ([#21434][_#21434])
* OsqpSolver option ``adaptive_rho_interval`` is parsed as an ``int`` instead of a ``double``  ([#21434][_#21434])
* In HPolyhedron to VPolytope, fix a linear solver bug, and also a related bug where vertices with non-unique hyperplane descriptions would throw ([#21527][_#21527])
* Add missing ``tol`` argument to ``VPolytope(H: HPolyhedron)`` ([#21536][_#21536])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [breaking change] TBD [multibody] Deny set_contact_surface_representation post-Finalize ([#21559][_#21559])  # Changing this value in the middle of a simulation fails to properly invalidate the contact surface cache entries. Rather than try to fix that (which would be extremely complicated), instead we fail-fast. The contact surface representation (triangle vs polygon) must now be configured pre-Finalize.
* [feature] TBD Implements MultibodyPlant::GetConstraintIds() ([#21483][_#21483])  # Resolves 21482. At minimum, this enables one to remove constraints from the plant that might have been added during parsing, without using internal methods (which are not bound in pydrake).
New features

* ``SceneGraph`` now accepts and uses a ``SceneGraphConfig`` ([#21366][_#21366])
* ``SapSolver<AutoDiffXd>::SolveWithGuess`` propagates gradients ([#21431][_#21431])
* ``DifferentialInverseKinematics`` allows setting solver options ([#21433][_#21433])
* Add ``SpatialInertia::IsZero`` sugar accessor ([#21515][_#21515])

Fixes

* Update default proximity properties resolution hint ([#21511][_#21511])
* Fix uniqueness of RenderEngineGl buffers across instances ([#21466][_#21466])
* Change some ``...InPlace`` functions to return void ([#21438][_#21438])

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

New features

* ``GcsTrajectoryOptimization`` supports adding nonlinear derivative bounds ([#21459][_#21459])
* ``GcsTrajectoryOptimization`` supports adding nonlinear continuity constraints ([#21480][_#21480])

Fixes

* None
