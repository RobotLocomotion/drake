title: Drake v1.22.0
date: 2023-10-16
released: 2023-10-16
---

# Announcements

* The EventStatus return value is now fully propagated through the System and
  Simulator API ([#20035][_#20035]).
  * This can be useful for systems that need to signal the "reached
    termination" condition from inside of a Diagram, or otherwise denote
    _recoverable_ failures (i.e., without throwing exceptions).
* Drake now provides Python 3.12 wheels for Ubuntu ([#20299][_#20299]).
  * macOS support for Python 3.12 is still in progress.
* Drake now provides a pip-compatible index for installing the nightly build
  into a virtual environment ([#20189][_#20189]).
  * Refer to [Installation via Pip](/pip.html#nightly-releases) for
    instructions.
* Drake's support for macOS Monterey (i.e., macOS 12) has reached end of life,
  as documented on our [OS Support](/stable.html#os-support) page and the
  [Supported Configurations](/installation.html#supported-configurations)
  table. This will be the last Drake release that supports macOS Monterey.

# Breaking changes since v1.21.0

* In MultibodyPlant, automatically-added floating joint names no longer have a
  ``$world_`` prefix ([#20253][_#20253]).
  * During the deprecation window ``GetJointByName()`` will strip the old prefix as
    partial compatibility support, but this does not cover all cases.
* The System class now officially disallows direct inheritance ([#20035][_#20035]).
  * The only direct descendants possible are LeafSystem and Diagram. Users must
    derive from those classes rather than directly from System. Likely this
    won't affect anyone.
* System event dispatch order may have changed ([#20035][_#20035])
  * If user code overrides a System dispatcher function (e.g., DoPublish()) but
    also invokes the base class default implementation, execution of the default
    dispatch code is now deferred until the user's DoPublish() returns;
    previously it was executed immediately at the invocation point.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
