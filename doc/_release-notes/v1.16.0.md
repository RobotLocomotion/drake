title: Drake v1.16.0
date: 2099-01-01
released: 2099-01-01
---

# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v1.15.0

* Filter contact results for completely locked trees ([#19349][_#19349])
  * The members of `ContactResults` will no longer be in bijection with the geometry quantities (`PenetrationAsPointPair` and `ContactSurface`) that inform the solver of contact. Geometric contact data between completely locked trees will simply be ignored.
  * Any program that made the assumption that: num_contact_results = num_point_pairs + num_contact_surfaces will be broken.
  
Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.16.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{focal|jammy|mac|mac-arm64}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
