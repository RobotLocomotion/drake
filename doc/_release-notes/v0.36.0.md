## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD [multibody] Deprecate ModelWeldErrorFunction ([#15949][_#15949])
* TBD [geometry:optimization] Add python bindings for GraphOfConvexSets ([#15974][_#15974])  # Also lifts the BindIdentifier logic out of geometry_py_common.cc (next to the equivalent BindTypeSafeIndex) so that it can be used in geometry_py_optimization.cc.
* TBD [meshcat] Adds MeshcatPointCloudVisualizer ([#15938][_#15938])  # Adds a c++ LeafSystem to publish point clouds, following the python MeshcatPointCloudVisualizer.
* TBD [meshcat] Adds recording methods to MeshcatVisualizerCpp ([#15937][_#15937])  # Based on the model used in MeshcatVisualizer python, but with more thorough documentation. This is a follow-up to #15800.
* TBD [geometry,multibody,examples] [hydro] Rename SurfaceMesh to TriangleSurfaceMesh ([#15962][_#15962])  # In order so that PolygonSurfaceMesh looks like a sibling of SurfaceMesh, we're renaming SurfaceMesh to TriangleSurfaceMesh. This entails a number of additional changes: - Rename the mesh's apis from generic "face" to "triangle". num_faces() and faces() are now num_triangles() and triangles(). - Parameters of the mesh API that previously referred to "faces" now refer to "triangles". - It remains in some places where the generic concept of face is relevant regardless of number of vertices (i.e., face_normal()). - SurfaceMeshFieldLinear has been changed to TriangleSurfaceMeshFieldLinear. - ReadObjToSurfaceMesh has been changed to ReadObjToTriangleSurfaceMesh.
* TBD [multibody,geometry,examples] [meshcat] Adds MeshcatContactVisualizer ([#15968][_#15968])  # This is a cleaned-up C++ version of the MeshcatContactVisualizer in meshcat_visualizer.py .  It uses meshcat more effectively now, by simply setting the forces visible=False; this will also be compatible with animations that will include the forces (which never worked before).
* TBD [geometry/optimization] IrisInConfigurationSpace with Ibex ([#15789][_#15789])
* TBD [geometry:optimization] Add GetGraphvizString to GraphOfConvexSets ([#16017][_#16017])
* TBD [geometry:optimization] cleanup memory management in GraphOfConvexSets ([#16016][_#16016])  # Replaces unordered_map and unordered_set with containers that will provide consistent ordering. Also - Adds Vertices() access method. - Add some missing python bindings. API breaking changes: - VertexIds() has been removed.  Use Vertices() instead. - The return value of Edges is now std::vector instead of std::unordered_set. These change were made without deprecation, per the "Experimental API" warning in the GraphOfConvexSets class documentation.
* TBD Toppra: Use one solver for every optimization and fix zero velocity bug ([#15964][_#15964])
* TBD Remove deprecated 2021-11 geometry legacy collision filters ([#16029][_#16029])
* TBD [geometry,multibody,examples] geometry: Migrate hydroelastic modulus in property functions ([#16009][_#16009])  # Relevant to: #15796 This is a breaking change, mitigated by the experimental status of hydroelastic contact support. This patch migrates hydroelastic_modulus (HEM) from being a generic material property to being a property specific to hydroelastic contact. To accomplish this, AddContactMaterial loses its HEM argument, and AddSoftHydroelasticProperties gains one. In addition, the underlying property entry moves from the "material" group to the "hydroelastic" group. Refactoring note: to make the transition of identically typed arguments safer, obsolete or unused overloads were first removed to help disambiguate parsing of call sites, and subsequently the argument and property name transitions were done. This patch squashes all those steps together. In addition, a few typos and minor errors were corrected.

* TBD [manipulation,examples,multibody] Convert package URIs to use top-level drake manifest ([#15947][_#15947])  # All package URIs used within Drake's publicly accessible data now use `package://drake/...` URIs, according to the top-level manifest. This now deprecates the individual manifests that are no longer used within Drake.
