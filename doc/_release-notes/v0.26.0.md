title: Drake v0.26.0
released: 2021-01-21
---

# Announcements

* In a future release, the DrakeVisualizer system will become templated on
  `<typename T>` to support multiple scalar types ([#14547][_#14547]).
  * To insulate your code from this change, we now offer a C++ alias
    `drake::geometry::DrakeVisualizerd` (i.e., with a "d" suffix) that
    matches the current uses of a `double` system.
  * We recommend that C++ users preemptively refactor to use this new alias, so
    the addition of the template in a future release will not be a breaking
    change.  See ([#14547][_#14547]) for examples.
  * Python users do not need to make any preemptive changes.  The new template
    argument will not disturb pydrake.

# Breaking changes since v0.25.0

* Downgrade the spdlog external to release 5.1.0 and fmt external to release 6.1.2 ([#14427][_#14427]).
* FixInputPort and DeclareAbstractState no longer allow for mutation through an alias ([#14453][_#14453]).
* Remove support for the add_package_path stanza in multibody parsing model directives  ([#14529][_#14529]).

* Allow sphinx-build to be missing during bazel fetch ([#14528][_#14528])
* Add dependency on TRI common_robotics_utilities; for now this is only used by test code, but in a future release will be used by a forthcoming new drake/planning/... library ([#14437][_#14437], [#14530][_#14530])
* Add dependency on TRI voxelized_geometry_tools ; for now this is only used by test code, but in a future release will be used by a forthcoming new drake/planning/... library ([#14437][_#14437], [#14530][_#14530])

Changes specific to macOS:

* Use fmt and spdlog from homebrew ([#14517][_#14517], [#14427][_#14427])
* Allow brew to be found in the PATH ([#14496][_#14496])

* The ability for MeshcatVisualizer to use a pose_bundle input port ([#14292][_#14292])

  * This was actually deprecated in v0.25.0, but the initial announcement for that release forgot to list it.
