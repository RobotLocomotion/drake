# Changes since v1.44.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* Rename IrisInConfigurationSpace to IrisNp ([#23282][_#23282])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* Fix `geometry::QueryObject<T>::HasCollisions()` bug - anchored geometry is no longer confusing ([#23409][_#23409])
* Fix model instance coordinate counts when child frame and body are in different instances ([#23380][_#23380])

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Add a trivial hyperplane in IrisNp2 at the initial guess if a solve fails ([#23410][_#23410])  # Fix bug where all but the last hyperplane was being used when there are additional constraints.

New features

* IrisParameterizationFunction supports AutoDiff when constructed from RationalForwardKinematics ([#23340][_#23340])

Fixes

* Fix bug where all but the last hyperplane was being used when there are additional constraints ([#23408][_#23408])
* Fix bug where IrisNp2 with additional constraints couldn't be used at the same time as a parameterization ([#23337][_#23337])

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->


New features

* Bind constructors for PyFunctionCost and PyFunctionConstraint ([#23291][_#23291])

Fixes

* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [tools,setup] [setup] Remove JRE and JDK from install_prereqs ([#23417][_#23417])  # Since we no longer install the LCM java tools, our binary packages don't depend on a JRE. When building Drake from source, instead of installing a JDK machine- wide we can ask Bazel to fetch one for us. This avoids cluttering up the whole machine, is more hermetic, and de-risks JDK version shear leading to build failures.
* [fix] TBD [tools,workspace,cmake,doc] [workspace] Optionally use glib from bzlmod ([#23398][_#23398])
* Document supported native CMake options ([#23339][_#23339])
* Fix macOS wheel internal RECORD file ([#23294][_#23294])
* Update macOS CMake to 4.1 ([#23286][_#23286])
* Update python venv (mac) to latest ([#23296][_#23296])
