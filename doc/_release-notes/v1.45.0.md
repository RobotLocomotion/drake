title: Drake v1.45.0
date: 2025-09-16
released: 2025-09-16
---

# Announcements

* As announced in [v1.37.0](v1.37.0.html), for Bazel users Drake has been ported
  to [Bazel modules](https://bazel.build/external/module) instead of repository
  rules. Drake's legacy support for `WORKSPACE` has been removed in this release
  ([#22660][_#22660], [#23248][_#23248]). Work is underway now to port relevant
  dependencies to use the Bazel Central Registry. Refer to the comments in
  [drake/tools/flags/BUILD.bazel](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/v1.45.0/tools/flags/BUILD.bazel)
  to see new flags you can use to govern the dependencies. Follow
  [#20731][_#20731] for updates.
