on API changes.

# Changes since v1.44.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* [newly deprecated] TBD [solvers,planning,geometry] Rename IrisInConfigurationSpace to IrisNp ([#23282][_#23282])  # This promotes better consistency with the interchangeable alternatives IrisZo and IrisNp2. We also create an Iris group in the C++ documentation, to make these methods more easily discoverable.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* [fix] TBD HasCollisions() bug fixed - anchored geometry is no longer confusing ([#23409][_#23409])  # If anchored geometry had bounding boxes that overlapped dynamic geometries' bounding boxes, but the actual geometry *didn't* collide, HasCollisions() would get confused and say there were no collisions, even if there were collisions between dynamic geometry. This removes that point of confusion.
* [fix] TBD Fix model instance coord counts when child frame & body in different instances ([#23380][_#23380])  # Also skip weld joints when generating coordinate names.

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->


New features

* [feature] TBD IrisParameterizationFunction supports AutoDiff when constructed from RationalForwardKinematics ([#23340][_#23340])

Fixes

* [fix] TBD Fix bug where all but the last hyperplane was being used when there are additional constraints ([#23408][_#23408])
* [fix] TBD Fix bug where IrisNp2 with additional constraints couldn't be used at the same time as a parameterization ([#23337][_#23337])

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->


New features

* [feature] TBD Bind constructors for PyFunctionCost and PyFunctionConstraint ([#23291][_#23291])

Fixes

* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [fix] TBD Fix macOS wheel RECORD ([#23294][_#23294])  # Rewrite logic to remove the MOSEK libraries from the macOS wheel to use the 'wheel' command to unpack and repack the wheel in order to perform modifications, rather than trying to perform the modifications in a more 'in place' manner. This is needed so that the wheel's RECORD is updated to reflect the changes. Accordingly, remove logic in 'change_lpath' to edit files inside wheels, since doing so results in a broken RECORD.
* [fix] TBD [doc,tools] [doc] Update macOS CMake to 4.1 ([#23286][_#23286])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade python venv (mac) to latest ([#23296][_#23296])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency bazel_skylib to v1.8.1 ([#23353][_#23353])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency apple_support to v1.23.1 ([#23356][_#23356])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency bazel_features to v1.35.0 ([#23357][_#23357])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency platforms to v1 ([#23363][_#23363])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_cc to v0.2.2 ([#23359][_#23359])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_java to v8.15.2 ([#23360][_#23360])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_python to v1.5.4 ([#23364][_#23364])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency zlib to v1.3.1.bcr.6 ([#23355][_#23355])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_shell to v0.6.0 ([#23362][_#23362])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_rust to v0.63.0 ([#23361][_#23361])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency spdlog to v1.15.3 ([#23354][_#23354])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency fmt to v11.2.0 ([#23358][_#23358])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_cc to v0.2.3 ([#23369][_#23369])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_rust to v0.64.0 ([#23370][_#23370])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_python to v1.6.0 ([#23381][_#23381])
* [fix] TBD [doc,tools] Update dependency bazel to v8.4.0 ([#23391][_#23391])
* [fix] TBD [doc,tools] [doc] Document supported native CMake options ([#23339][_#23339])  # Drake's build takes a number of `CMAKE_` options and converts them to Bazel flags. We should document such logic similar to the Drake-specific CMake options. Also, remove the `CMAKE_` prefix from the install name tool and strip tool options. These are not (and have never been) native CMake variables, and aside from the issue that CMake reserves that naming convention, it's just confusing for developers.
* TBD
* [fix] TBD [solvers,workspace,multibody] [workspace] Upgrade osqp_internal,qdldl_internal to latest ([#22870][_#22870])  # Upgrade osqp_internal to latest release 1.0.0. Upgrade qdldl_internal to latest release 0.1.8.

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [workspace,tools,setup] [workspace] Switch to rules_jvm_external for maven deps ([#23404][_#23404])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade styleguide to latest commit ([#23338][_#23338])
* [removal of deprecated] TBD [workspace,tools,doc,geometry] [workspace] Remove legacy WORKSPACE support ([#23248][_#23248])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade ipopt_internal to latest release 3.14.19 ([#23375][_#23375])  # Fixup - provide now-required constants. ---------
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade highway_internal to latest release 1.3.0 ([#23377][_#23377])
* [fix] TBD [workspace,tools,common,geometry,doc] [workspace] Add cpplint_internal and use instead of styleguide ([#22689][_#22689])  # Patch the tool to allow our h-to-cc special case in our fork of the GSG. We also fix that logic (compared to the original styleguide repo's cpplint) to not fail-open, which means we need to adjust a few BUILD files so that h-cc file pairs get linted together.
* [newly deprecated] TBD [workspace,doc,tools] [workspace] Deprecate the styleguide external ([#23393][_#23393])
* [newly deprecated fix] TBD [workspace,tools,solvers,multibody,common,systems,geometry,planning] [tools] Modernize more bazel module dependencies ([#23383][_#23383])  # - Use buildifier_prebuilt from BCR. - Use gflags from BCR. - Use googletest from BCR. - Deprecate our buildifier module extension. - Deprecate our gflags module extension. - Deprecate our gtest module extension. - Deprecate out pycodestyle module extension.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade abseil_cpp_internal to latest commit ([#23373][_#23373])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade common_robotics_utilities_internal to latest commit ([#23373][_#23373])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade mujoco_menagerie_internal to latest commit ([#23373][_#23373])

## Newly-deprecated APIs

* [newly deprecated] TBD [solvers,planning,geometry] Rename IrisInConfigurationSpace to IrisNp ([#23282][_#23282])  # This promotes better consistency with the interchangeable alternatives IrisZo and IrisNp2. We also create an Iris group in the C++ documentation, to make these methods more easily discoverable.
