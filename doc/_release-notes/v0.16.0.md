title: Drake v0.16.0
---

# Announcements

* New tutorial on nonlinear programming ([#12744][_#12744])
* The C++ Doxygen pages are somewhat less cluttered now ([#12795][_#12795], [#12796][_#12796])

# Breaking Changes since v0.15.0

These are breaking changes that did not undergo a deprecation period:

* Drake no longer supports user-defined scalar types ([#12657][_#12657], [#12797][_#12797], [#12823][_#12823], [#12816][_#12816], [#12825][_#12825])
  * See issue [#12814][_#12814] for more details.
* Removed the ability to override LeafSystem allocation methods ([#12792][_#12792])
  * Subclasses should use the model vector (or model value) APIs to declare
    state, parameters, etc. instead of overriding these virtual methods.
* Removed pydrake.examples.AcrobotPlant.CalcPotentialEnergy ([#12794][_#12794])
* Removed pydrake.examples.AcrobotPlant.CalcKineticEnergy ([#12794][_#12794])
* Renamed RigidBodyTree-based implementation of
  drake::manipulation::planner::ConstraintRelaxingIk to
  drake::manipulation::planner::ConstraintRelaxingIkRbt ([#12732][_#12732])
* Removed godotengine build rules ([#12826][_#12826])

# Changes since v0.15.0:

* Implemented Composite Body Algorithm to compute the mass matrix ([#12764][_#12764])
* Discrete-mode MultibodyPlant is faster, particularly in cases with branched
  kinematics, due to incorporation of Composite Body Algorithm in the discrete solver ([#12838][_#12838])
* New hydroelastic contact model in progress ([#12597][_#12597], [#12699][_#12699], [#12751][_#12751],
  [#12763][_#12763], [#12745][_#12745], [#12730][_#12730], [#12840][_#12840])
