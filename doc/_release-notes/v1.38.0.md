# Announcements

* Build changes
  * When building from source, there is now a single `setup/install_prereqs`
    script for all platforms, which defaults to installing only the build
    prereqs (not developer prereqs) ([#22461][_#22461]).
  * When building from source, Drake can optionally build BLAS and LAPACK from
    source on Ubuntu ([#22529][_#22529]).
    For CMake users, set `WITH_USER_BLAS` and/or `WITH_USER_LAPACK` to `OFF` to
    have Drake build them from source.
    For Bazel users, use the new `//tools/flags:private_runtime_repo_default`
    or `:blas_repo` or `:lapack_repo`.
  * The macOS binary `install_prereqs` installs Python packages into a venv
    instead of system-wide ([#22477][_#22477]), and macOS binary packages no
    longer use brew for eigen/fmt/spdlog ([#22519][_#22519]).
  * The macOS pip wheels for Python 3.11 are deprecated and will no longer be
    published after v1.40.0 (approximately 2025-04-15) ([#22581](_#22581)).
  * Render engines now dynamically load GL/GLX/EGL/OpenGL instead of linking
    them ([#22494][_#22494]).
  * As announced in [v1.37.0](v1.37.0.html), for Bazel users Drake has been
    ported to [Bazel modules](https://bazel.build/external/module) instead of
    repository rules.
    * Please start porting your project to the new technology. See the
      [drake_bazel_external](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-external-examples/tree/main/drake_bazel_external)
      example for how to use this from your project.
    * Refer to the comments in
      [drake/tools/flags/BUILD.bazel](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/tools/flags/BUILD.bazel)
      to see new flags you can use to govern the dependencies.
    * We plan to deprecate Drake's legacy `WORKSPACE` support in our next
      release (v1.39.0). For timeline updates, follow [#20731][_#20731].
* Be careful when directly adding multibody elements ([#22498][_#22498]):
  Python code must no longer assume that the object passed
  `MultibodyPlant.AddJoint`, `MultibodyPlant.AddFrame`, or
  `MultibodyPlant.AddForceElement` is what gets added to the plant. Instead,
  code should always capture the return value, i.e.:
  ```py
  # Good:
  joint = plant.AddJoint(PrismaticJoint(...))
  # Also okay:
  joint = PrismaticJoint(...)
  joint = plant.AddJoint(joint)
  ```
  but in this example:
  ```py
  # Needs care:
  joint = PrismaticJoint(...)
  plant.AddJoint(joint)
  ```
  the original `joint` reference will NOT necessarily be part of the plant, so
  would probably be a mistake to be used thereafter.

# Breaking changes since v1.37.0

* Drake's generated C++ LCM message headers now use `std::array`
  ([#20761][_#20761]). The class `drake::EigenMapView` might help with porting.
* Remove MUMPS support in wheel builds of Ipopt ([#22489][_#22489]). This was
  already deprecated, but we found the need to accelerate the timeline.
* The `vector<vector<Binding>>` return types for KinematicTrajectoryOptimization
  AddAccelerationBounds and AddJerkBounds are now `vector<Bindings>`
  ([#22552][_#22552]).
* The protected API of the Joint base class (for implementing custom joints) is
  no longer Stable API ([#22620][_#22620]).
  * Third-party subclasses of Joint must adapt to a new API ([#22608][_#22608]).
    See changes to internal joints in this PR for guidance.
* Remove the ability for Python subclasses of `MaxCliqueSolverBase` to override
  the `DoClone` virtual function ([#22425][_#22425]). The `Clone` function is
  deprecated and unused anyway, so hopeful this won't be a problem in practice.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

	including Drake's command line wrappers such as `drake-lcm-spy`.
  * If you still need those LCM tools, build LCM as an ExternalProject using its
    first-party CMakeLists.txt build instead of Drake's re-implementation.

## Removal of deprecated items

* None

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.38.0) named
``drake-1.38.0-{jammy|noble|mac-arm64}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
