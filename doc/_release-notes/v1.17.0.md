title: Drake v1.17.0
date: YYYY-MM-DD
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* This release follows quickly on the heels of v1.16.0 in order to remain
  compatible with macOS Homebrew's recent upgrade to fmt 10.
  * On macOS (except for pip), Drake now uses and requires fmt 10.
  * To use fmt 9, stick with Drake version v1.16.0 or prior.

# Breaking changes since v1.16.0

* None

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Changes since v1.16.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->


New features

* None

Fixes

* Simplfy the creation of empty images ([#19443][_#19443])


## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->


New features

* None

Fixes

* None

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [multibody] Including joint locking in forward dynamics computations ([#19420][_#19420])  # This change enables the use of `Joint::Lock()/Unlock()` and `Body::Lock()/Unlock()` on a continuous mode `MultibodyPlant`. Simulation updates will always compute 0 accelerations for locked dofs and state for locked dofs will remain fixed at their values in the context at the time `Lock()` is called.
* [fix] TBD [render_gl] Support multithreaded operation (sometimes) ([#19323][_#19323])  # Each thread must be given its own unique RenderEngineGl instance. Add thread stress test to confirm.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->


New features

* Add velocity bounds to edges between subgraphs ([#19357][_#19357])

Fixes

* None

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* Add missing table of contents entry for "Taking derivatives of MultibodyPlant with respect to mass" ([#19439][_#19439])

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [math,systems] Check IsStabilizable and IsDetectable in ContinuousAlgebraicRiccatiEquation ([#19300][_#19300])
* [fix] TBD Overload Trajectory::vector_values to accept Eigen::VectorXd ([#19422][_#19422])  # This makes it easier (in c++) to, for instance, using Eigen::LinSpaced to sample at regular intervals from a trajectory.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [pydrake] Add binding for LinearComplementarityConstraint M and q ([#19445][_#19445])
* [fix] TBD [visualization] Add codec configuration to VideoWriter ([#19447][_#19447])  # Switch the default codec to the more portable mp4v instead of avc1.
* [feature] TBD [pydrake] Add binding for UnrevisedLemkeSolver ([#19453][_#19453])
* [breaking change fix] TBD Fix default arguments for GetStateNames() and friends to match C++ ([#19455][_#19455])  # The python bindings for MultibodyPlant::GetStateNames() as well as GetPositionNames, GetVelocityNames, and GetActuatorNames had slightly different default values than in c++.  This update makes them consistent.

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [setup] Remove NLopt dependency from Ubuntu ([#19427][_#19427])  # This has been unused for a while.
* [fix] TBD [setup] Remove NLopt dependency from macOS ([#19428][_#19428])  # This has been unused for a while.
* [fix] TBD Fix build errors vs fmt 10 ([#19451][_#19451])
* [fix] TBD [common,solvers] [common] Provide fmt helper for consistent floating point output ([#19454][_#19454])  # This fixes unit test failures when testing against fmt 10. It's important to use this formatter when creating structured data files, so that they are consistent. It is not necessary to use this formatter for ephemeral output like log messages.

## Build dependencies

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.17.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{focal|jammy|mac|mac-arm64}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
