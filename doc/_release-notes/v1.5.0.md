## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

New features

Fixes

* TBD

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD Updates some docs on MultibodyPlant's finalize preconditions ([#17445][_#17445])  # . Some of these methods should throw an exception if called pre-finalize. For now we warn users in the documentation and tell them these methods will throw at a future date.
* TBD [parsing] Add ProcessModelDirectives overload for simplicity ([#17450][_#17450])  # There's no need to pass a MultibodyPlant when we already have a Parser. There's no need to use an output argument instead of a return value.
* TBD [multibody,examples] For progress on issue #17080, remove redundant default mass in body.h in favor of default mass in rigid_body.h ([#17472][_#17472])
* TBD [inverse_kinematics] Update global IK ([#17504][_#17504])  # - Change one remaining use of Isometry3 to RigidTransform (and deprecate old version) - Implements AddWorldRelativePositionConstraint - Adds Python bindings - Makes argument naming to consistent use body_index; before we had some body_index and some body_idx
* TBD [parsing] Add missed check in SDFormat drake:proximity_properties ([#17510][_#17510])  # Relevant to: #16785 (already closed) This patch adds a missed call to CheckSupportedElements() for the SDFormat parsing of drake:proximity_properties. It fixes some typos in the (previously unused) supported element data. It also adds new test clauses to ensure the checking is executed.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD Use AcrobotParams for AcrobotPlant::SetMitAcrobotParameters ([#17423][_#17423])  # * Change input to AcrobotPlant::SetMITAcrobotParameters to AcrobotParams. The previous input was systems::Parameters, which won't work. Change the function name to SetMitAcrobotParameters to conform to GSG
* TBD [examples,tutorials,manipulation] [pydrake] Deprecate MeshcatVisualizerCpp vestigial spelling ([#17462][_#17462])  # Users should just say MeshcatVisualizer instead. Ditto for MeshcatPointCloudVisualizerCpp.
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* TBD [lcm,tools] [lcm] Remove build-time transitive dependency on LCM headers ([#17442][_#17442])
* TBD [common,systems,solvers,math,multibody,geometry,tools,examples] [common] Extract core symbolic algebra into its own library ([#17419][_#17419])  # The vast majority of Drake code only uses the basic algebra of Variable, Expression, and Formula; it does not use extra analysis on top (polynomials, rationals, decomposition, simplification, etc.). By carving out Expression (and closely-related classes) into its own library, we can improve Drake's build times. Our pervasively-used default scalars now only pull in the basic algebra support, not all of the extra analysis code. This commit both adds such a library, and updates Drake to use it in cases where the extra code is not required.
* TBD [common,tools,multibody] [common,multibody,tools] Remove deprecated code 2022-07 ([#17461][_#17461])
* TBD [common] Deprecate autodiffxd_make_coherent ([#17499][_#17499])  # This code has been unused for some time.
* TBD [common,solvers,systems,examples,tools] [common] Extract remaining symbolic files into smaller libraries ([#17479][_#17479])
* TBD [common] Add deprecation shims for symbolic files ([#17479][_#17479])
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD Python bindings for CameraInfo fov_x and fov_y ([#17428][_#17428])
* TBD [visualization] Add --host option to meldis ([#17477][_#17477])  # This allows for binding to addresses other than localhost.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

Newly bound

* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* TBD [pydrake] Defer tkinter import from load-time to ctor-time ([#17438][_#17438])  # The pyplot_visualizer is the only installed module that depends on pyplot (and thus, depends on tkinter by default on Ubuntu). We want `import pydrake.all` to provide `PyPlotVisualizer` but we don't want it to bomb out at import-time for users who never use it. Instead, we defer the import of pyplot until ctor-time, and give a friendly error message in case python3-tk is missing.
* TBD

## Build dependencies

* TBD [workspace] Upgrade abseil_cpp_internal to latest commit ([#17431][_#17431])  # To get the fix of abseil/abseil-cpp#1191 for #17412.
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade gtest to latest release release-1.12.0 ([#17452][_#17452])
* TBD Update pybind11 to address numpy 1.23 issue ([#17475][_#17475])  # Update to newer pybind11 to address a change in numpy 1.23 that caused some arrays to fail to be converted to Eigen matrices.
* TBD [workspace] Update picosat to latest commit ([#17505][_#17505])  # Closes: #17139 Also drop disablement of UBSan checks specific to picosat; that is no longer needed, thanks to fixes upstream.
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade petsc to latest release v3.17.3 ([#17509][_#17509])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade abseil_cpp_internal to latest commit ([#17496][_#17496])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade common_robotics_utilities to latest commit ([#17496][_#17496])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade gtest to latest release release-1.12.1 ([#17496][_#17496])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade rules_python to latest release 0.10.0 ([#17496][_#17496])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade tinyobjloader to latest commit ([#17496][_#17496])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade stduuid to latest commit ([#17496][_#17496])
