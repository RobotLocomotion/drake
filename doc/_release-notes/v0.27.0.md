title: Drake v0.27.0
released: 2021-02-16
---

# Announcements

* macOS Big Sur 11.x is now supported on Intel Macs ([#14632][_#14632])

# Breaking changes since v0.26.0

* DrakeVisualizer class is now templatized ([#14569][_#14569])
    * We offer a C++ alias ``drake::geometry::DrakeVisualizerd`` (i.e., with a
      ``d`` suffix) that matches the current uses of the ``double`` system.
    * Python users do not need to make any changes. The new template
      argument will not disturb pydrake.
    * Certain compilers may not be able to infer the template argument (e.g.,
      when referring to static methods).
* ``end_effector_teleop_sliders`` is no longer supported on macOS ([#14632][_#14632])

# Notes

This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v0.27.0) named
``drake-20210216-{bionic|focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
