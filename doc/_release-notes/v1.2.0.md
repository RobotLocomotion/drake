# Announcements

# Breaking changes since v1.1.0

# Changes since v1.1.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* TBD Add the smooth formulation of augmented Lagrangian ([#16845][_#16845])  # The slack variable s becomes a decision variable in the augmented Lagrangian. This is the same formulation used in LANCELOT.
* TBD [MathematicalProgram] Add convex quadratic constraint as rotated Lorentz cone constraint ([#16921][_#16921])  # * Add convex quadratic constraint as rotated Lorentz cone constraint. The conic solvers prefer rotated Lorentz cone constraint rather than the non-conic quadratic constraint.

New features

Fixes

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD Make joint locking use correct indices for joint/body velocities ([#16818][_#16818])  # Make joint locking use correct indices for joint/body velocities
* TBD Upgrade SpatialMomentum documentation and keyword arguments for Python ([#16844][_#16844])  # * Respond to Sherm's comments. * Improve language. * Add Python bindings. * Respond to Sherm's comments. * Add consistent verbage. * Remove in SpatialForce.h as this will occur in a pending PR. * Fix documentation bug. * Change deprecation date from 2022-07-01 to 2022-08-01.
* TBD Upgrade SpatialForce documentation and keyword arguments for Python. (#16851) ([#16851][_#16851])
* TBD Add a new frame Abar to specify the PositionConstraint bound ([#16873][_#16873])
* TBD [geometry/optimization] Expose the costs and constraints of an Edge in GraphOfConvexSets ([#16892][_#16892])  # * Expose the costs and constraints of an Edge in GraphOfConvexSets
* TBD [multibody] Filter collisions within welded subgraphs ([#16920][_#16920])  # Closes: #16422 This is a generalization of the the already-existing code to filter collisions within bodies welded to the world.  Now, we filter collisions within any welded subgraph of the model. On the way to constructing a test, remove some unused infrastructure and (mostly) prefer method calls to multiple optional constructor parameters. Also, back-fill a test that should have accompanied PR #11116.

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD [examples/rimless_wheel] Improve meshcat animation ([#16906][_#16906])  # Previously, the floating-base pose that was sent to the visualizer changed discontinuously at each step.  This is fine for forward simulation, but in meshcat's animation the interpolation effects of scrubbing through frames caused visual artifacts.  This PR simply unwraps the pitch angle to make it continuous during a simulation. It also adds some missing const specifier to the accessor functions (which were needed to write the test).
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* TBD [common,solvers] Use std::vector instead of Eigen::Vector in ExtractAndAppendVariablesFromExpression ([#16896][_#16896])  # * Overload ExtractVariablesFromExpression for a vector of expressions. Speed up extracting variables by avoiding repeated linear number of heap memory allocation within a for loop. Speed up parsing linear constraints by reducing number of heap memory allocation.
* TBD [manipulation,examples] Update the Jaco LCM systems ([#16863][_#16863])  # Splits the position and velocity ports in the Jaco LCM interface to better match other robots' LCM systems (e.g. iiwa).
* TBD [common,systems] [trajectory] PiecewiseQuaternion returns Vector4 as values ([#16914][_#16914])  # . The original implementation violates the contract set in the base class that the size of the result of value() is equal to rows()-by-cols().
* TBD

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.2.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{bionic|focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
