title: Drake v1.2.0
date: 2022-04-20
released: 2022-04-20
---

# Announcements

* Drake's binary release now incorporate the MOSEKâ„¢ solver ([#16927][_#16927]).
  * Users must supply their own ``MOSEKLM_LICENSE_FILE`` license environment
    in order to use the solver, but no longer need to build Drake from source
    to do so.
* Drake no longer supports Ubuntu 18.04 "Bionic", Python 3.6, or Python 3.7
  ([#13391][_#13391]).
* Drake no longer supports drake-visualizer on macOS ([#16945][_#16945]).
  * Instead, Drake now offers a meshcat display server named
    [meldis](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/pydrake.visualization.meldis.html)
    that speaks the same protocol as ``drake_visualizer`` ([#16263][_#16263]).

# Breaking changes since v1.1.0

* None

Note that ``drake::trajectories::PiecewiseQuaternionSlerp::value()`` now returns
a quaternion, instead of a rotation matrix ([#16914][_#16914]). This is not a
breaking change (because the documentation promised a quaternion), but we note
it here in case anyone was depending on the prior behavior.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
