title: Drake v1.2.0
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* Drake no longer supports Ubuntu 18.04 "Bionic", Python 3.6, or Python 3.7
  ([#13391][_#13391]).

# Breaking changes since v1.1.0

* None

Note that ``drake::trajectories::PiecewiseQuaternionSlerp::value()`` now returns
a quaternion, instead of a rotation matrix ([#16914][_#16914]). This is not a
breaking change (because the documentation promised a quaternion), but we note
it here in case anyone was depending on the prior behavior.

# Notes

This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.2.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
