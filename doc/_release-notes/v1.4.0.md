title: Drake v1.4.0
date: 2022-06-21
released: 2022-06-21
---

# Announcements

* Drake now supports loading MuJoCo's MJCF format ([#17358][_#17358])
  * Note that not all elements of the file format are supported yet, but many
    of the most commonly-used element are available.
* Drake's collision filter groups in SDFormat and model directives may now span
  multiple robots ([#17175][_#17175], [#17270][_#17270]).

# Breaking changes since v1.3.0

* Direct access to MultibodyPlant's [scalar-converting copy
  constructor](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__system__scalar__conversion.html)
  has been removed ([#17354][_#17354]).
  * This constructor was intended to be for internal use only, but was not marked
    as such; now it is.
  * Anyone who was accidentally using this constructor might now receive a linker
    error, for certain compilers.
  * To perform scalar conversion of a System, C++ users should call, e.g.,
    ``System::ToAutoDiffXd`` instead of the direct constructor.
  * Python users are unaffected.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
