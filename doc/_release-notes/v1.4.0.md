# Changes since v1.3.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->


New features

* Add SharedPointerSystem ([#17260][_#17260])

Fixes

* Add error guidance to Get*Port methods ([#17255][_#17255])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->


New features

* Add GetAvailableSolvers() ([#17225][_#17225])
* CsdpSolver accepts RemoveFreeVariableMethod via SolverOptions ([#17275][_#17275])

Fixes

* Fix SparseMatrixToTriplets to only permit sparse matrices ([#17331][_#17331])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD Remove model instance restrictions in ComInPolyhedronConstraint ([#15830][_#15830])
* TBD [parsing] Enable multi-robot collision filter groups ([#17175][_#17175])  # Relevant to: #14785 This patch extends the parsing of collision filter groups so that collision filters can be defined across multiple robots by using SDFormat model composition. Summary of changes: * add CollisionFilterGroupResolver, with unit test * port existing parser modules to use it * modernize a few sdf_parser errors * demonstrate multi-robot filters in sdf_parser_test
* TBD [multibody] Add meshcat JointSliders::SetPositions ([#17247][_#17247])  # - Enable the sliders to be updated using a vector of positions the same length as the MultibodyPlant::num_positions(), indices that correspond to joint sliders will update the meshcat UI. - Add corresponding python bindings and related tests.
* TBD [plant] MbP throws exceptions on NaN input port values ([#17174][_#17174])
* TBD Add error guidance to Get*ByName methods ([#17259][_#17259])  # Along with #17255, resolves #14426
* TBD [geometry] Reject duplicate-named frames for same source ([#17243][_#17243])  # Closes: #7122 Track the set of frame names for each source, and use that to reject duplicates. Add a unit test for the new message, and adjust some other tests that needlessly used duplicate names.
* TBD [parsing] Add collision filters via model directives ([#17270][_#17270])  # Closes: #17242 Define a new directive for collision filters (equivalent to current XML formats), and enable multi-model collision filter processing in ProcessModelDirectives.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD [tutorials,doc] [tutorials] Add tutorial for using Mosek on Deepnote ([#17213][_#17213])  # I have hosted the tutorial draft [here](https://deepnote.com/workspace/russtedrake-b58d8141-6691-43e8-ad76-0575b319c8b8/project/Enabling-licensed-solvers-on-Deepnote-7581ca0c-04be-4632-9108-f0426b6c3fbb/%2Flicensed_solvers_deepnote.ipynb) for code review.
* TBD [examples] Add meshcat sliders / buttons to manipulation_station ([#16816][_#16816])  # - Always create the `meshcat` instance regardless of `args.hardware`. - Replace the deprecated python `JointSliders` with `multibody.meshcat`. - Add a new meshcat specific `SchunkWsgButtons` helper class to open and close the gripper. - Note: when using this against hardware, if the gripper is closed when we run joint_teleop then the teleop will command gripper-open and the robot would drop whatever it's holding.  However, that is the same behavior as the old code and will be fixed in a followup. Co-authored-by: Stephen McDowell <stephen.mcdowell@kitware.com>
* TBD [examples] Update manipulation station end_effector sliders Meshcat ([#17292][_#17292])  # - Use C++ bound `pydrake.geometry.Meshcat` over the deprecated pure python Meshcat interface. - Replace the tkinter sliders with Meshcat sliders. - Remove the keyboard controls that were available as an alternate control mechanism for the sliders.  The simulation / robot can only be controlled using the Meshcat sliders now.
* TBD [examples] Update manipulation station end_effector mouse Meshcat ([#17298][_#17298])  # - Use C++ bound `pydrake.geometry.Meshcat` over the deprecated pure python Meshcat interface. - Meshcat argument `--open_browser` is now `-w` or `--open-window` for consistency with the other examples. - Meshcat argument `--meshcat` requests the meshcat interface, previous options related to ZMQ url etc are no longer available.
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* TBD [planner] Add a keep_going option to ConstraintRelaxingIk ([#17224][_#17224])
* TBD [geometry] Update geometry_inspector to multibody.meshcat ([#17214][_#17214])  # - Replace deprecated python only MeshcatVisualizer with the C++ multibody.meshcat. - Meshcat is always created and used in order to create the JointSliders. - Remove --joint_position option which has no analagous C++ method.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD Add python binding for SceneGraph::RemoveGeometry ([#17336][_#17336])

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

Newly bound

* TBD

## Build system

* Add libpython as Ubuntu binary tarball prerequisite ([#17294][_#17294])
* Fail fast if setup script is invoked with sudo when already root ([#17284][_#17284])
