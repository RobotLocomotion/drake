# Changes since v1.3.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->


New features

* Add SharedPointerSystem ([#17260][_#17260])

Fixes

* Add error guidance to Get*Port methods ([#17255][_#17255])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* TBD [solvers,tools,doc] [solvers] Upgrade to Mosek 9.3.20 ([#17238][_#17238])  # As proposed in #17237.
* TBD add GetAvailableSolvers() ([#17225][_#17225])  # Returns the available solvers for a given program type.
* TBD CsdpSolver accepts RemoveFreeVariableMethod via SolverOptions ([#17275][_#17275])  # Also deprecate the constructor with RemoveFreeVariableMethod argument.
* TBD [solvers,math] [math] Fix SparseMatrixToTriplets to only permit sparse matrices ([#17331][_#17331])  # When it was given a dense matrix by mistake, it included all of the zeros in the returned triplets. Fix OsqpSolver to not try to pass a dense matrix.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD Remove model instance restrictions in ComInPolyhedronConstraint ([#15830][_#15830])
* TBD [parsing] Enable multi-robot collision filter groups ([#17175][_#17175])  # Relevant to: #14785 This patch extends the parsing of collision filter groups so that collision filters can be defined across multiple robots by using SDFormat model composition. Summary of changes: * add CollisionFilterGroupResolver, with unit test * port existing parser modules to use it * modernize a few sdf_parser errors * demonstrate multi-robot filters in sdf_parser_test
* TBD [multibody] Add meshcat JointSliders::SetPositions ([#17247][_#17247])  # - Enable the sliders to be updated using a vector of positions the same length as the MultibodyPlant::num_positions(), indices that correspond to joint sliders will update the meshcat UI. - Add corresponding python bindings and related tests.
* TBD [plant] MbP throws exceptions on NaN input port values ([#17174][_#17174])
* TBD Add error guidance to Get*ByName methods ([#17259][_#17259])  # Along with #17255, resolves #14426
* TBD [geometry] Reject duplicate-named frames for same source ([#17243][_#17243])  # Closes: #7122 Track the set of frame names for each source, and use that to reject duplicates. Add a unit test for the new message, and adjust some other tests that needlessly used duplicate names.
* TBD [parsing] Add collision filters via model directives ([#17270][_#17270])  # Closes: #17242 Define a new directive for collision filters (equivalent to current XML formats), and enable multi-model collision filter processing in ProcessModelDirectives.

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD [tutorials,doc] [tutorials] Add tutorial for using Mosek on Deepnote ([#17213][_#17213])  # I have hosted the tutorial draft [here](https://deepnote.com/workspace/russtedrake-b58d8141-6691-43e8-ad76-0575b319c8b8/project/Enabling-licensed-solvers-on-Deepnote-7581ca0c-04be-4632-9108-f0426b6c3fbb/%2Flicensed_solvers_deepnote.ipynb) for code review.
* TBD [examples] Add meshcat sliders / buttons to manipulation_station ([#16816][_#16816])  # - Always create the `meshcat` instance regardless of `args.hardware`. - Replace the deprecated python `JointSliders` with `multibody.meshcat`. - Add a new meshcat specific `SchunkWsgButtons` helper class to open and close the gripper. - Note: when using this against hardware, if the gripper is closed when we run joint_teleop then the teleop will command gripper-open and the robot would drop whatever it's holding.  However, that is the same behavior as the old code and will be fixed in a followup. Co-authored-by: Stephen McDowell <stephen.mcdowell@kitware.com>
* TBD [examples] Update manipulation station end_effector sliders Meshcat ([#17292][_#17292])  # - Use C++ bound `pydrake.geometry.Meshcat` over the deprecated pure python Meshcat interface. - Replace the tkinter sliders with Meshcat sliders. - Remove the keyboard controls that were available as an alternate control mechanism for the sliders.  The simulation / robot can only be controlled using the Meshcat sliders now.
* TBD [examples] Update manipulation station end_effector mouse Meshcat ([#17298][_#17298])  # - Use C++ bound `pydrake.geometry.Meshcat` over the deprecated pure python Meshcat interface. - Meshcat argument `--open_browser` is now `-w` or `--open-window` for consistency with the other examples. - Meshcat argument `--meshcat` requests the meshcat interface, previous options related to ZMQ url etc are no longer available.
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* TBD [planner] Add a keep_going option to ConstraintRelaxingIk ([#17224][_#17224])
* TBD [geometry] Update geometry_inspector to multibody.meshcat ([#17214][_#17214])  # - Replace deprecated python only MeshcatVisualizer with the C++ multibody.meshcat. - Meshcat is always created and used in order to create the JointSliders. - Remove --joint_position option which has no analagous C++ method.
* TBD [common,manipulation,math] Remove deprecated code 2022-06 ([#17296][_#17296])
* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* TBD [tools,multibody] workspace: Upgrade libsdformat to latest release 12.5.0 ([#17250][_#17250])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade petsc to latest release v3.17.1 ([#17273][_#17273])  # Co-authored-by: Betsy McPhail <betsy.mcphail@kitware.com> Co-authored-by: Xuchen Han <xuchen.han@tri.global>
* TBD [workspace] Deprecate json external ([#17283][_#17283])
* TBD [setup] Fail fast if invoked with sudo when already root ([#17284][_#17284])
* TBD [tools,geometry] [workspace] Remove msgpack boost dependency ([#17286][_#17286])
* TBD [workspace] Install libpython for consumers ([#17294][_#17294])  # Relates: #17161. If consumers do a tar or deb install with --no-install-recommends they will not be able to run the python code without libpython.
* TBD [pydrake] Remove deprecated pydrake modules 2022-06 ([#17295][_#17295])
* TBD [tools,geometry] [workspace] Improve qhull hidden visibility ([#17229][_#17229])  # When building C++ code, we should not use -fvisibility=hidden because it infects all #included code, even the standard library. This causes a lot of console spam during macOS builds, and is a typeinfo (vtable) problem even on Ubuntu, potentially leading to ODR violation. Instead, we should wrap the third-party C++ code in a inline hidden namespace.  That way, only the third-party code itself is hidden, not anything that it #includes. We are substantially patching and subsetting this library to weave it into Drake. We shouldn't give the illusion to users that it's available for reuse downstream; therefore, we'll add an "_internal" suffix and deprecate the original repository name.
* TBD [workspace] Deprecate boost external ([#17308][_#17308])
* TBD [tools,multibody] [workspace] Flag sdformat, ignition_math, ignition_utils as internal ([#17303][_#17303])  # We are substantially patching these libraries to weave them into Drake. We should not give the illusion to users that they are available for reuse downstream. Also take this opportunity to track the ignition => gz project rename.
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade abseil_cpp_internal to latest commit ([#17322][_#17322])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade dm_control to latest commit ([#17322][_#17322])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade ignition_math to latest release ignition-math6_6.11.0 ([#17322][_#17322])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade libcmaes to latest commit ([#17322][_#17322])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade stduuid to latest commit ([#17322][_#17322])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade common_robotics_utilities and voxelized_geometry_tools ([#17322][_#17322])  # The changes in voxelized_geometry_tools require the changes from common_roboticis_utilities.
* TBD
