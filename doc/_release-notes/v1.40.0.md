title: Drake v1.40.0
date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* Drake's Python wheels on Linux are now based on `manylinux_2_34` (instead of
  `manylinux_2_35`) ([#22779][_#22779]).
  * This allows wheels to install and run on more platforms such as Amazon Linux
	2023, AlmaLinux 9, RHEL 9, etc.
* Linux wheels for Python 3.13 are now available ([#22580][_#22580]).
  * Drake's python bindings no longer use a RobotLocomotion fork of pybind11;
    instead, the bindings use the upstream version plus two custom patches
    ([#22738][_#22738]). Downstream Bazel projects that reuse Drake's copy of
    pybind11 for their own bindings will probably need to adjust their code
    to be compatible with the updated pybind11.

# Breaking changes since v1.39.0
