title: Drake v1.40.0
date: 2025-04-12
released: 2025-04-12
---

# Announcements

* New tutorial "Configuring Rendering Lighting" ([#22631][_#22631])
* macOS packages now use Python 3.13 ([#22827][_#22827])
  * The macOS pip wheels for Python 3.12 remain supported.
  * The macOS pip wheels for Python 3.11 remain deprecated and will no longer be
    published in future releases ([#22581](_#22581)).
* Drake's Python wheels on Linux are now based on `manylinux_2_34` (instead of
  `manylinux_2_35`) ([#22779][_#22779]).
  * This allows wheels to install and run on more platforms such as Amazon Linux
	2023, AlmaLinux 9, RHEL 9, etc.
* Linux wheels for Python 3.13 are now available ([#22580][_#22580]).
  * Drake's python bindings no longer use a RobotLocomotion fork of pybind11;
    instead, the bindings use the upstream version plus two custom patches
    ([#22738][_#22738]). Downstream Bazel projects that reuse Drake's copy of
    pybind11 for their own bindings will probably need to adjust their code
    to be compatible with the updated pybind11.
* Mesh and Convex geometries now allow non-uniform scaling (including mirroring
  via negative scale). This allows Drake's to load model files which use such
  scaling ([#22046][_#22046]).
