released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v1.35.0

* In `MathematicalProgram`, the return value of `AddPrincipalSubmatrixIsPsdConstraint` for a matrix of `symbolic::Expression` has changed. It now returns `Binding<LinearMatrixInequalityConstraint>`. ([#22234][_#22234])
* In `GcsTrajectoryOptimization`, the spelling of method `UnwrapToContinous` has bee corrected to `UnwrapToContinuous`. ([#22280][_#22280])

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->


New features

* [feature] TBD Add Expression Costs and Formula Constraints to EdgesBetweenSubgraphs in GcsTrajectoryOptimization ([#22155][_#22155])
* [feature] TBD Add Generic Binding<Cost> and Binding<Constraint> to vertices and edges within a GcsTrajectoryOptimization::Subgraph ([#22179][_#22179])  # This PR includes Python bindings.
* [feature] TBD Implements IRIS ZO ([#22168][_#22168])  # Implements the IRIS-ZO (Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite programming - Zero Order) algorithm described in the following paper https://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Werner24.pdf . This algorithm constructs probabilistically collision-free polytopes in robot configuration space while only relying on a collision checker.
* [feature] TBD Add Generic Binding<Cost> and Binding<Constraint> to vertices and edges within a GcsTrajectoryOptimization::EdgesBetweenSubgraphs ([#22199][_#22199])

Fixes

* [fix] TBD Fixes bug in IrisFromCliqueCover edge case ([#22239][_#22239])  # Fixes edge case in iris from clique cover and adds test coverage for the edge case.
* [fix] TBD fixes broadcasting bug in irisfromcliquecover ([#22246][_#22246])
* [breaking change fix] TBD Fix typo: UnwrapToContinous => UnwrapToContinuous ([#22280][_#22280])  # It was spelled incorrectly in an impressive number of places, including the public (experimental) API.

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [common] Add fmt_debug_string polyfill ([#22150][_#22150])
* [fix] TBD [common] Work around linker error with clang 16+ ([#22172][_#22172])  # This patch avoids linker errors seen with clang 16 through 18 seen on both macos and ubuntu noble. Somehow, without this patch, the compiler emits undefined symbols containing the Drake-only using-statement type `MatrixX`.
* [newly deprecated fix] TBD Improve ExtractAndAppendVariablesFromExpression ([#22201][_#22201])  # Use std::vector<symbolic::Variable> instead of Eigen::VectorX<symbolic::Variable> for faster resizing.
* [fix] TBD [math,solvers] Hot fix on 22223 ([#22273][_#22273])  # fmt::join requires #include <fmt/ranges.h>.
