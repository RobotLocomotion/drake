title: Drake v1.36.0
date: 2024-12-13
released: 2024-12-13
---

# Announcements

* On macOS when building from source, Drake now requires Xcode 16 or newer.
* For Bazel users, take note that Drake has begun porting to
  [Bazel modules](https://bazel.build/external/module) instead of repository
  rules. Please start studying the new technology and how it will impact you.
  After Drake has good support for modules, we plan to deprecate Drake's
  repository rules for removal. For progress updates, follow
  [#20731][_#20731]. To see our up-to-date best advice for how to depend on
  Drake from your own project, follow
  [drake-external-examples](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-external-examples/).
* For `IpoptSolver` on Ubuntu, we now support setting the Ipopt solver option
  `"linear_solver"` to `"spral"` (instead of the default of `"mumps"`). We
  encourage users to try out SPRAL and provide feedback. We intend to change the
  default to SPRAL in a future release (for both macOS and Ubuntu), and to
  eventually deprecate and remove support for MUMPS entirely.

# Breaking changes since v1.35.0

* In `MathematicalProgram`, the return value of `AddPrincipalSubmatrixIsPsdConstraint` for a matrix of `symbolic::Expression` has changed. It now returns `Binding<LinearMatrixInequalityConstraint>`. ([#22234][_#22234])

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
