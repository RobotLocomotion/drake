# Changes since v1.35.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [framework] Update scalar conversion test utility ([#22188][_#22188])  # As of Xcode 16 or so, it is no longer safe to blithely dynamic_cast a system to a type that it has statically forbidden conversion support for. Instead, check (statically) for conversion support, and only then step through the dynamic conversion test steps. Give a nice error message if the conversion is forbidden statically. While here, revert an obsolete compiler workaround, and fold the implementation code down from two copies to one.
* [fix] TBD [framework] Speed up feedthrough calculation during diagram building ([#21632][_#21632])  # In certain cases, we now avoid calling AllocateContext when answering direct feedthrough queries.

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Return dual solution for PSD constraint in SCS and Clarabel ([#22147][_#22147])  # Include dual for both PositiveSemidefiniteConstraint and LinearMatrixInequalityConstraint.
* [newly deprecated fix] TBD Deprecate SemidefiniteRelaxationOptions flag `preserve_convex_quadratic_constraints` ([#22123][_#22123])  # This flag provably has no impact on the result of the mathematical program. --------- Co-authored-by: Russ Tedrake <russt@mit.edu> Co-authored-by: amice <amice@mit.edu>
* [fix] TBD Fix a bug in MosekSolver on parsing PSD matrix with repeated variable ([#22173][_#22173])  # When one positive-semidefinite (PSD) matrix of symbolic variables contain a repeated variable, with one of the entry being off-diagonal, the parsing was incorrect. For example, if we have a PSD matrix of [x(0), x(1), x(2)] [x(1), x(1), x(3)] [x(2), x(3), x(4)] where both the (0, 1) entry and (1, 1) entry contain the same variable, and the (0, 1) entry is an off-diagonal entry, then we had a bug to parse this PSD constraint. This PR fixes the bug.
* [feature] TBD Add PSD constraint for a scalar as a linear constraint in Mosek ([#22141][_#22141])
* [feature] TBD SCS and Clarabel parses scalar PSD constraint as linear constraint ([#22200][_#22200])
* [fix] TBD Compute Minimal Representation of Degenerate VPolytopes ([#22220][_#22220])  # Fixes cases for VPolytopes that are empty, that have one vertex, whose ambient dimension is 1, and that lie along a proper affine subspace of the full ambient space. All four cases would previously fail, since they cannot be handled by QHull directly.
* [feature] TBD Add MathematicalProgram::AddLinearMatrixInequalityConstraint() for a matrix of symbolic Expressions ([#22211][_#22211])
* [feature] TBD Scs and Clarabel parses 2x2 PSD/LMI constraints as second order cone constraints ([#22219][_#22219])  # A second order cone problem is easier to solve than a positive semidefinite programming problem.
* [breaking change feature] TBD Discourage AddPositiveSemidefiniteConstraint() for a matrix of symbolic::Expression ([#22234][_#22234])  # Instead should use AddLinearMatrixInequalityConstraint() which adds a linear matrix inequality constraint. This avoids adding additional PSD matrix variable and linear equality constraints.
* [feature] TBD Mosek imposes linear or rotated quadratic constraint for small-size LMI constraints ([#22238][_#22238])  # For LMI on a 1x1 matrix, we impose linear inequality constraint. For LMI on a 2x2 matrix, we impose a rotated quadratic constraint (rotated Lorentz cone constraint)
* [removal of deprecated] TBD [solvers,multibody] Remove deprecated code 2024-12 ([#22248][_#22248])
* [feature] TBD Mosek parses PSD constraint on 2x2 matrix as rotated Lorentz cone ([#22231][_#22231])
* [feature] TBD Parallelize the Rounding Stage of GCS ([#22222][_#22222])
* [feature] TBD [solvers,math] Reproduce the SCS program with python code ([#22223][_#22223])  # We can specify solver options standalone_reproduction_file_name to write a python script, that will reproduce the optimization program in SCS.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [parsing] Fix a shadowed variable error in dmd parser ([#22175][_#22175])  # First seen on macos with xcode 16.
* [feature] TBD Allow reversed weld joints ([#22122][_#22122])
* [fix] TBD Improve error message when MbP meets unknown geometries ([#22178][_#22178])
* [feature] TBD [geometry] ComputeSignedDistanceToPoint from meshes ([#21471][_#21471])
* [feature] TBD [multibody,workspace,geometry] Differentiate visual roles in .sdf file ([#22013][_#22013])  # This introduces the <drake:perception_properties> and <drake:illustration_properties> tags. It further implicitly introduces a drake-namespaced version of all of the tags at the <visual> level and below. Note: in this version the <drake:foo_properties> don't have any supported children. They simply have an "enabled" attribute which can turn off the role (no further functionality).
* [fix feature] TBD RenderEngineVtk can be forced into PBR mode ([#22170][_#22170])  # Adds a new parameter to RenderEngineVtkParams. Rather than waiting for the engine's lighting model to get promoted based on its content, it can be pushed into that mode upon construction. This also fixes a bug in which cloned instances forgot whether or not phong materials should be automatically promoted to PBR.
* [fix] TBD [multibody,examples,geometry,systems,doc] Updates and documents MultibodyPlant's default proximity values ([#21463][_#21463])  # This PR updates the default value of proximity properties used by MbP. The idea is that a user can create a model without specifying any contact parameters and run a first simulation with a reasonable approximation of rigid contact. For tighter "rigid contact" or furhter compliance, users of course must provide their contact parameters estimations. This workflow and guidelines for estimation are documented in a new module. Label "release:fix" is related to the fact that these new contact parameters defaults affect the behavior of Drake's simulations.

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Add Expression Costs and Formula Constraints to EdgesBetweenSubgraphs in GcsTrajectoryOptimization ([#22155][_#22155])
* [feature] TBD Add Generic Binding<Cost> and Binding<Constraint> to vertices and edges within a GcsTrajectoryOptimization::Subgraph ([#22179][_#22179])  # This PR includes Python bindings.
* [feature] TBD Implements IRIS ZO ([#22168][_#22168])  # Implements the IRIS-ZO (Iterative Regional Inflation by Semidefinite programming - Zero Order) algorithm described in the following paper https://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Werner24.pdf . This algorithm constructs probabilistically collision-free polytopes in robot configuration space while only relying on a collision checker.
* [fix] TBD Fixes bug in IrisFromCliqueCover edge case ([#22239][_#22239])  # Fixes edge case in iris from clique cover and adds test coverage for the edge case.
* [fix] TBD fixes broadcasting bug in irisfromcliquecover ([#22246][_#22246])
* [feature] TBD Add Generic Binding<Cost> and Binding<Constraint> to vertices and edges within a GcsTrajectoryOptimization::EdgesBetweenSubgraphs ([#22199][_#22199])
* [breaking change fix] TBD Fix typo: UnwrapToContinous => UnwrapToContinuous ([#22280][_#22280])  # It was spelled incorrectly in an impressive number of places, including the public (experimental) API.

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [common] Work around linker error with clang 16+ ([#22172][_#22172])  # This patch avoids linker errors seen with clang 16 through 18 seen on both macos and ubuntu noble. Somehow, without this patch, the compiler emits undefined symbols containing the Drake-only using-statement type `MatrixX`.
* [feature] TBD [common] Add fmt_debug_string polyfill ([#22150][_#22150])
* [newly deprecated fix] TBD Improve ExtractAndAppendVariablesFromExpression ([#22201][_#22201])  # Use std::vector<symbolic::Variable> instead of Eigen::VectorX<symbolic::Variable> for faster resizing.
* [fix] TBD [math,solvers] Hot fix on 22223 ([#22273][_#22273])  # fmt::join requires #include <fmt/ranges.h>.
* TBD

* [feature] TBD Python bindings for methods of GcsTrajectoryOptimization::EdgesBetweenSubgraphs for adding generic costs and constraints ([#22177][_#22177])
* [feature] TBD Add python binding for `AffineBall::MakeAffineBallFromLineSegment` ([#22254][_#22254])  # Resolves #22250.

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade rules_cc to 0.0.16 ([#22183][_#22183])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Use built-in rules_python for Bazel >= 8 ([#22237][_#22237])
* [fix] TBD [tools] Accept bzlmod's spelling of local_config_cc ([#22235][_#22235])  # In Bazel 8, the local_config_cc repository name is different.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade rules_cc to latest release 0.0.17 ([#22263][_#22263])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade nlopt_internal to latest release v2.9.1 ([#22257][_#22257])  # --------- Co-authored-by: Rick Poyner <rick.poyner@tri.global>

* [feature] TBD [workspace,solvers,tools] [solvers] IpoptSolver can use SPRAL on Ubuntu ([#22206][_#22206])  # By default, IpoptSolver uses MUMPS to solve the linear program. Users can now set the solver option "linear_solver" to "spral" to use SPRAL instead (for now, on Ubuntu only). We anticipate switching the default solver to be SPRAL in a future release. Add new build dependencies to the workspace: - Add gklib_internal - Add metis_internal - Add spral_internal Teach our fortran.bzl how to compile f90 modules. Run ipopt_solver_test with both linear solvers. Adjust license checker to allow British spelling.
