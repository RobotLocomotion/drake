title: Drake v1.39.0
date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v1.38.0


* The *protected* Joint API has changed. This will only affect you if you have
  created a custom joint. The Joint::MakeMobilizerForJoint() can now create Frames. ([#22649][_#22649])
* `drake::planning::CollisionCheckerParams::model` has gone from `std::unique_ptr` to `std::shared_ptr`.
  This constitutes an important semantic change, but is unlikely to cause downstream issues. ([#22619][_#22619])



Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

* Fix wrong port name in `SchunkWsgTrajectoryGenerator` documentation  ([#22671][_#22671])

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [tools,doc] [build] CMake options for solver opt-out ([#22626][_#22626])
* [fix] TBD [doc,tools] [setup] Upgrade Bazel to latest release 8.1.1 ([#22690][_#22690])  # Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>

* TBD

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [breaking change fix] TBD [workspace,geometry] Correct VTK's image-based lighting diffuse calculation ([#22629][_#22629])  # Look at the associated patch to see the explanation of the change. (scaled_albedo_for_ibl.patch). The unit tests that used environment maps have had their reference values all darkened (as expected). This constitutes a breaking change in that any test that used a reference image from RenderEngineVtk (using an environment map) will now create a darker image.
* [fix] TBD [workspace,geometry] Preserve direct light specular reflections for smooth materials ([#22632][_#22632])  # This tweaks the mathematical model so that perfect reflections of our direct lighting don't dwindle away to nothing (counter to how they would behave in the real world).
* [newly deprecated] TBD [workspace,tools,doc] [build] Deprecate using Drake as a workspace external ([#22660][_#22660])
