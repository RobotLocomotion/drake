title: Drake v1.39.0
date: 2025-03-14
released: 2025-03-14
---

# Announcements

* As announced in [v1.37.0](v1.37.0.html), for Bazel users Drake has been ported
  to [Bazel modules](https://bazel.build/external/module) instead of repository
  rules. Drake's legacy support for `WORKSPACE` is now deprecated and will be
  removed on or after 2025-09-01. ([#22660][_#22660])
* MultibodyPlant's `*_desired_state` input ports for implicit PD control are now
  much easier to use (i.e., come with fewer restrictions). ([#22542][_#22542],
  [#22715][_#22715])
* The *protected* Joint API has changed. This will only affect you if you have
  created a custom joint. Joint::MakeMobilizerForJoint() can now create Frames. ([#22735][_#22735])
* VTK's lighting calculations for image-based lighting has been corrected. The
  implication is that renderings that use an _environment map_ will get a bit
  dimmer. (The environment map was mistakenly contributing too much energy to
  the scene). To account for this correction, you may need to dim your explicit
  lights (spot, point, etc.) slightly and increase your `exposure` to rebalance
  the exposure of the final image. ([#22629][_#22629])
* Calling `FiniteHorizonLinearQuadraticRegulator() will invoke discrete-time
  finite-horizon LQR under certain circumstances. See the function documentation
  for details. ([#22609][_#22609])

# Breaking changes since v1.38.0

* `drake::planning::CollisionCheckerParams::model` has gone from `std::unique_ptr` to `std::shared_ptr`.
  This constitutes an important semantic change, but is unlikely to cause downstream issues. ([#22619][_#22619])


Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
