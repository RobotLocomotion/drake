title: Drake v1.39.0
date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* VTK's lighting calculations for image-based lighting has been corrected. The implication is that renderings that
  use an _environment map_ will get a bit dimmer. (The environment map was mistakenly contributing too much
  energy to the scene). To account for this correction, you may need to dim your explicit lights (spot, point, etc.)
  slightly and increase your `exposure` to rebalance the exposure of the final image. ([#22629][_#22629])

# Breaking changes since v1.38.0

* `drake::planning::CollisionCheckerParams::model` has gone from `std::unique_ptr` to `std::shared_ptr`.
  This constitutes an important semantic change, but is unlikely to cause downstream issues. ([#22619][_#22619])


Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
