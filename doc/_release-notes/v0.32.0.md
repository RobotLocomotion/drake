# Breaking changes since v0.31.0

* The Drake collision filter has been entirely switched to a new mechanism ([#15297][_#15297]).  This creates a number of small API changes to classes that we do not believe that anyone is relying on.
  * Changes to the underlying collision filter implementation has led to the removal of drake/common/sorted_vector_have_intersection.h
* Drake has upgraded its libsdformat version; the more recent sdformat libraries are stricter ([#15075][_#15075])
  * Drake now enforces stricter validation of SDFormat attributes. Before, any unrecognized attributes previously printed a warning to the console. Now, unrecognized attributes will cause an exception to be thrown. Please note that unrecognized **elements** do not yet cause a warning or error to be issued.
* ExpressionCell's API has been adjusted to be more const-correct ([#15364][_#15364])
  * This changes some low-level Expression casting operations that (while not in an `internal` namespace) are internal implementation details unlikely to affect downstream users.
* Doxygen throws clauses only mention std::exception ([#15336][_#15336])
  * This change loosens the documented exception type of a large number of Drake classes.  No actual behaviour is changed and few users should have been relying on precise exception behaviour.
* Drake Visualizer now uses drake's native lcmtypes for drawing rather than bot_core's ([#15284][_#15284])
  * Drake visualizer as shipped no longer supports the bot_core messages for point clouds and lidar (downstream projects with their own lcmtypes are probably already vendoring drake-visualizer anyway).
