title: Drake v0.32.0
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v0.31.0

* The Drake collision filter has been entirely switched to a new mechanism ([#15297][_#15297]).  This creates a number of small API changes to classes that we do not believe that anyone is relying on.
  * Existing API on GeometryState has been re-expressed in terms of the new collision filter mechanism.
  * ProximityEngine has entirely lost its collision filtering logic. It now relies on the CollisionFilter class to do "apply" declarations.
  * The "sorted vectors have intersection" supporting code in the common directory is no longer used and is removed.
  * All explicit references to "cliques" are removed (InternalFrame no longer tracks "frame cliques"; Testing is no longer expressed in terms of cliques; GeometryState and ProximityEngine have lost clique-related APIs)
  * Removal of the attorney between geometry state and collision filters.
  * All callbacks that were dependent on CollisionFilterLegacy have their declared type changed
* Drake has upgraded its libsdformat version; the more recent sdformat libraries are stricter ([#15075][_#15075])
  * Drake now enforces stricter validation of SDFormat attributes. Before, any unrecognized attributes previously printed a warning to the console. Now, unrecognized attributes will cause an exception to be thrown. Please note that unrecognized elements do not yet cause a warning or error to be issued.
