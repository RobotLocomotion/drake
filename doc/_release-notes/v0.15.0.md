title: Drake v0.15.0
---

# Announcements

This release includes a number of translations of consumers of the legacy
``RigidBodyTree`` simulator to the newer ``MultibodyPlant``, including every
example used by our MIT users.

A number of substitutes for what are now C++ standard library mechanisms have
completed their voyage through the deprecation pipeline; we bid farewell to
``drake_optional``, ``drake_variant``, and the Spruce filesystem library in this
release.

# Breaking Changes

These are breaking changes that did not undergo a deprecation period.

* Removed some hydroelastic property setter methods:
  * Remove ``MultibodyPlant::set_elastic_modulus`` ([#12596][_#12596])
  * Remove ``MultibodyPlant::set_hunt_crossley_dissipation`` ([#12596][_#12596])
  * We believe this API, although public, has no downstream users.
* Hide ``filesystem.h`` from downstreams ([#12686][_#12686])
  * We believe this API, although public, has no downstream users.
* Re-implement the uniformly random rotation to actually be uniform ([#12562][_#12562])
  * This has caused some problems for consumers: The existing behaviour,
    although wrong, was relied on by some downstream code.

# Dynamical Systems

New features

* Support Gaussian initial conditions in Affine/Linear systems ([#12637][_#12637])
* Enable ``math::ComputeNumericalGradient()`` for scalar types ``T != double`` ([#12629][_#12629])
