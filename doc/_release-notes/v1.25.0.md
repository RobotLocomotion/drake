title: Drake v1.25.0
date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v1.24.0

* Drake no longer allows calling `schema::Transform::Sample()` when the `base_frame` field has been populated  ([#20756][_#20756]).
  * Use the new `SampleAsTransform()` method instead.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->


New features

* [fix feature] TBD [multibody,workspace] MJCF parser supports eulerseq (and fixes the default) ([#20620][_#20620])  # Towards #20232.  Related to #20444. In #20232 we realized that the default eulerseq in MJCF is "xyz", which is NOT the standard eulerseq in urdf/sdf. This PR fixes a bug in which we assumed the wrong eulerseq by default, leading to incorrect kinematics in some parsed models. It also adds support for non-default eulerseq. It also adds a test so that we can readily visualize the parsed kinematics from the dm_control suite which are being used to test the parser.
* [feature] TBD MJCF parser supports mesh defaults and assetdir ([#20621][_#20621])  # Mesh defaults can be used to set the scale of the assets globally. "assetdir" is another way to set the "meshdir". Towards #20444. Co-Authored-By: Rick Poyner <rick.poyner@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD Mujoco parser support for visual-only and/or collision-only geometry ([#20622][_#20622])  # Towards #20444. As discussed in https://drakedevelopers.slack.com/archives/C43KX47A9/p1697895553790089 , this PR: - avoids registering collision geometry for geom with contype==conaffinity==0 - avoids registering visual geometry for group > 2. Also implements, per the mujoco documentation, that zero-radius spheres are the default geometry if no other type/size is mentioned.
* [feature] TBD Implements MultibodyPlant::RemoveConstraint ([#20720][_#20720])  # Adds a pre-finalize method to remove MbP constraints. An example use case for this is when I've parsed a gripper into my plant with the parser, but then want to go through and replace all of the joints with weld joints. In that workflow, I'll also have to remove any constraints that were added by the parser, but will now become invalid. Also adds an error message when somebody adds constraints and _then_ calls set_discrete_contact_approximation to TAMSI.
* TBD

Fixes

* [fix] TBD Correct window sizing in RenderEngineGl ([#20695][_#20695])  # If a RenderEngineGl is asked to render and *display* an image that didn't match the default window size in the OpenGlContext, it would hang. This is because the resizing would wait for xwindows to provide an expose event. However, if the window isn't visible yet (i.e., it's being resized before being made visible), there won't be such an event. This leads to the process hanging, waiting for an event that will never come. We've changed the context's default window size. The test on the OpenGlContext is sufficient to test the expected outcome.
* [fix] TBD [plant] Remove false const on get_mutable_joint_actuator ([#20750][_#20750])
* [fix] TBD [plant] Fix exception safety bug in AddJointActuator ([#20751][_#20751])
* [fix] TBD InverseKinematics: set non-zero initial guess for quaternion joints ([#20624][_#20624])
* [fix] TBD [multibody/parsing] Improve error handling of AddFrame ([#20773][_#20773])  # Throws an error earlier in the parsing if the specified frame is not deterministic. Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* TBD
