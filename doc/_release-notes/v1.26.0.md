title: Drake v1.26.0
date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v1.25.0

* The `FindSeparationCertificateOptions.num_threads` property is now deprecated in Python, and removed in C++. Use `parallelism` instead ([#20776][_#20776]).


Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Changes since v1.25.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* Update MonteCarlo to use Parallelism API ([#20785][_#20785])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->


New features

* IrisOptions: add more user control over termination ([#20645][_#20645])

Fixes

* Adjust "cspace free" to use the Parallelism helper ([#20776][_#20776])
* Remove ShapeReifier as a public base of ConvexSet ([#20832][_#20832])
* Remove explicit constructor on struct IrisOptions ([#20845][_#20845])
* Adjust ClarabelSolver default tolerances ([#20844][_#20844])
* Implement `mixing_steps` for uniform sampling in HPolyhedra ([#20817][_#20817])
* When removing GCS vertex, also fully remove adjacent edges ([#20875][_#20875])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [geometry,multibody] [geometry] Add Shape::type_name, Shape::to_string, and fmt formatter ([#20870][_#20870])  # Deprecate the (awkward) ShapeName and (unused) ShapeToString reifiers, which were the prior mechanisms to obtain the Shape::type_name and Shape::to_string values. Refactor Shape to use a vtable instead of copying reference-counted std::function objects everywhere. Implementing vtables by hand is confusing and wasteful.
* [newly deprecated] TBD [geometry] Deprecate SceneGraphInspector::Reify ([#20872][_#20872])  # This (untested) sugar is not used anywhere.

New features

* Add support for non-world reference frames to differential inverse kinematics ([#20735][_#20735])
* Add optional role parameter to GetAllGeometryIds ([#20834][_#20834])

Fixes

* Defer surface meshing for deformables when inactive ([#20822][_#20822])
* Serve the environment map over http ([#20793][_#20793])
* Fast initialize compliant-hydroelastic nonconvex meshes and deformables ([#20798][_#20798])
* Fix bug in glTF depth and label representations ([#20854][_#20854])
* 
* Allow add_directives of directives including collision filters ([#20757][_#20757])

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->
 
* [feature] TBD [planning,solvers] Support wraparound edges for unbounded revolute joints when adding edges between subgraphs ([#20700][_#20700])
* [fix] TBD Fix index query bug in PairwiseIntersectionsContinuousJoints ([#20857][_#20857])  # fix index bug in PairwiseIntersectionsContinuousJoints

New features

* Partition convex sets to satisfy convexity radius property ([#20655][_#20655])

Fixes

* TBD

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* Make Meshcat's server return 404 (not 200) on failures ([#20790][_#20790])
* Fix Meshcat browser console error messages ([#20791][_#20791])
* [feature] TBD [common,multibody,geometry] [common] Add Sha256 utility class ([#20779][_#20779])
* [fix] TBD Fix for SchunkWsgTrajectoryGenerator failing on delta=0 ([#20828][_#20828])  # There was a particular set of initial conditions which could cause the trajectory generator to fail, because it passed times=[0, 0, 0] to the PiecewisePolynomial.FirstOrderHold, which then complained about non-increasing times. This PR adds a test which captures the failure, and the fix.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* [fix] TBD Bind Hyperrectangle::MaybeCalcAxisAlignedBoundingBox ([#20804][_#20804])
* [fix] TBD [py geometry] Release the GIL during blocking Meshcat operations ([#20810][_#20810])
* [fix] TBD [pydrake] Release the GIL during "Run" functions ([#20811][_#20811])

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [tools,doc] Build macOS wheels for multiple Python versions ([#20616][_#20616])  # Rework macOS wheel build scripts to use Python-version-specific permanent locations for all operations, with temporary symlinks used for operations shared with the Linux wheel builds that expect non-versioned locations. Also rework builder to support a set of Python targets and to be able to build multiple wheels in a manner similar to how things work for Linux. This changes the macOS wheel build to produce wheels for (as of writing) both Python 3.11 and 3.12.
* [fix] TBD [wheel] Upgrade Eigen to latest release 3.4.0 on Linux ([#20802][_#20802])  # The prior version (3.3.7) is too old for Clarabel. The macOS version is unchanged (remains 3.4.0).
* TBD

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [fix] TBD Bump CRU with fixes for parallel-for exception handling ([#20786][_#20786])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade meshcat to latest commit ([#20805][_#20805])
* [fix] TBD [workspace,tools] [wheel] Enable ClarabelSolver on Linux ([#20802][_#20802])  # Previously, Linux wheels for Python <= 3.11 had it mistakenly disabled.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade crate_universe to latest ([#20814][_#20814])  # Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD [workspace,geometry] Fix bugs in VTK's glTF parser logic ([#20818][_#20818])  # - A material with only non-color textures would ignore its textures. - A material with only non-color textures would erroneously report multiple UV texture coordinate sets. - Warnings in the glTF parser were coded to go straight to the console (no event observer could intervene).
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Remove macOS-specific logic for zlib ([#20829][_#20829])  # The benefit of teaching Bazel exactly which zlib headers XCode will use on macOS isn't worth this much complexity. We're trying to reduce our use of the determine_os() logic to better support more platforms. Rather than rewriting this logic to be safe on additional platforms, it's easier just to toss it.
* [fix] TBD [workspace,geometry] [workspace] Upgrade VTK to latest commit ([#20765][_#20765])  # Remove unnecessary ViewpointUpdate code now that VTK is fixed. Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global> Co-authored-by: Sean Curtis <sean.curtis@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD Update drake_models ([#20858][_#20858])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade VTK to latest commit ([#20867][_#20867])  # Also unpin it so that it will be upgraded every month. This requires adding one more trampoline to the repository rule.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade meshcat to latest commit ([#20876][_#20876])
* TBD
