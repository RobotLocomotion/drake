## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* [newly deprecated fix] TBD [analysis] Update MonteCarlo to use Parallelism API ([#20785][_#20785])  # The following are deprecated: - drake::systems::analysis::kNoConcurrency - drake::systems::analysis::kUseHardwareConcurrency - drake::systems::analysis::MonteCarloSimulation overload that accepts the num_parallel_executions bare integer.

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [breaking change newly deprecated fix] TBD [optimization] Adjust "cspace free" to use the Parallelism helper ([#20776][_#20776])  # The FindSeparationCertificateOptions.num_threads property is now deprecated in Python, and removed (breaking change) in C++.
* [feature] TBD [solvers,planning] Partition convex sets to satisfy convexity radius property ([#20655][_#20655])  # A robot that has revolute joints without any limits has an inherently non-Euclidean configuration space, but one can still consider them "geodesically-convex" sets, akin to convex sets in Euclidean space. In practice, this only requires that the width of the set along each dimension corresponding to an unbounded revolute joint be strictly less than Ï€. This commit adds functions that are primarily used by GcsTrajectoryOptimization to make motion plans for these types of robots.
* [fix] TBD [optimization] Remove ShapeReifier as a public base of ConvexSet ([#20832][_#20832])  # Offering these functions up to users is at best misleading, and at worst a segfault (writing through an invalid static_cast). This is not a breaking change because ConvexSet is marked experimental.
* [fix] TBD Remove explicit constructor on struct IrisOptions ([#20845][_#20845])  # This allows for aggregate initialization, while still allowing default construction. Also fix a missing inline keyword in optimization_pybind.
* [fix] TBD [solvers] Adjust ClarabelSolver default tolerances ([#20844][_#20844])  # When the program contains both PSD and Exponential cones, we must loosen the default tolerance to reduce the possibility of crashing the entire process.
* [fix] TBD Implements mixing for uniform sampling in HPolyhedra ([#20817][_#20817])  # * added mixing steps as variable * build successfull * bindings updated, test updated * changes from code review * test coverage added for mixing_steps * Add check for mixing_steps, add additional test for mixing_steps parameter * https://drake.mit.edu/styleguide/cppguide.html#Use_of_const * add some blank lines for clarity * reflow format string Co-Authored-By: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD IrisOptions: add more user control over termination ([#20645][_#20645])  # Added an IrisOptions field named termination_func that takes the current polytope and decides whether to continue IRIS iterations. Some changes to IrisInConfigurationSpace: * Removed many break; lines in favor of returning the current polytope. I believe this makes the code easier to understand. * Throws error when starting_ellipse and sample disagree in a way that leads to invalid regions, as raised in issue #20623. * Added log lines on the reason that the algorithm terminated. Ideally we would have recorded this in the function return, but that would be a breaking change in the API. Other features: * MakeAffineBallFromLineSegment: a new static method for AffineBall. Helps building epsilon affine hyperellipsoids around a line segment. * SetIrisOptionsForEdge: sets up IrisOptions to compute an iris region from edge. * Minor bug fix: the volume of hyperellipsoids and affine balls can not be negative - take the absolute value of the determinant.
* [fix] TBD When removing GCS vertex, also fully remove adjacent edges ([#20875][_#20875])  # When removing vertex a, we'd delete edges (u, a) and (a, v). However, vertices u and v would still know about outgoing or incoming edges, respectively. This also clears the deleted edges from each vertex's set.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Add support for non-world reference frames to differential inverse kinematics ([#20735][_#20735])  # Adds two overloads to DoDifferentialInverseKinematics().
* [fix] TBD [geometry,common,multibody,solvers] [geometry] Meshcat's server returns 404 (not 200) on failures ([#20790][_#20790])  # This is also an opportunity to start to carve helper functions and classes out into separate files for easier maintenance. Two of the new functions are public and widely relevant: ReadFile and ReadFileOrThrow.
* [fix] TBD [geometry] Fix Meshcat browser console error messages ([#20791][_#20791])  # Firefox no longer warns about javascript mime types. StaticHtml output no longer errors out with an "Uncaught ReferenceError: urlParams is not defined".
* [fix] TBD [geometry] Defer surface meshing for deformables when inactive ([#20822][_#20822])  # When no deformable shapes appear in proximity engine, don't bother computing the deformables-specific surface meshes for rigid shapes since it will never be used and can be very expensive.
* [fix] TBD [geometry] Serve the environment map over http ([#20793][_#20793])  # The behavioral change here is a small one: when setting an environment map instead of it being copied into the property message as an inline data URI, the property message only contains the URL and image data is served over http. Primarily, this allows the browser to avoid re-requesting the image in case it's already downloaded it previously. It also has side benefits: the http image becomes easier to debug -- in the developer console it shows up as a separate request, including an inline image preview.  In theory it should also be faster to skip the base64 encoding in C++ and decoding in the browser, though that's not really measurable for just the environment map. The bigger picture is that the content-addressable storage technology introduced here can also eventually be used for resources beyond just the environment map, such as texture files, geometry files, object mesh files, etc. For testing the changes to meshcat.cc, the pre-existing unit and manual tests already have sufficient functional coverage. The only new thing we need is to test force-reload to make sure we're actually hitting the http server.
* [feature] TBD [geometry,solvers] [geometry] Add optional role parameter to GetAllGeometryIds ([#20834][_#20834])  # Use this in IRIS so obstacles are created in a deterministic order.
* [fix] TBD [geometry] Fast initialize compliant-hydroelastic nonconvex meshes and deformables ([#20798][_#20798])  # - Use BVH in CalcDistanceToSurfaceMesh(). - Skip calling CalcDistanceToSurfaceMesh() on boundary vertices.
* [fix] TBD Fix bug in glTF depth and label representations ([#20854][_#20854])  # When glTF objects were rendered in depth or label images, they would be (at least) rotated from where they should be. In fact, if a non-unit scale factor was applied, they'd also be scaled too much (the scale factor squared). This is because the creation of the color representation would modify the reference version before the depth and label versions were created. So, those later representations would accumulate an extra concatenation of the T_GF transform (the one that related the glTF file frame with the Drake geometry frame -- this transform incorporated both the 90-degree rotation from y-up to z-up and the Mesh/Convex scale factor).
* [newly deprecated] TBD [geometry,systems] [sensors] Deprecate Color, ColorI, ColorD, ColorPalette ([#20860][_#20860])  # Also deprecate some RenderEngine protected functions that use them: - RenderEngine::GetColorDFromLabel - RenderEngine::GetColorIFromLabel - RenderEngine::LabelFromColor
* [removal of deprecated] TBD [multibody,solvers,systems,workspace,geometry,examples,common,math,visualization] Remove deprecated code 2024-02 ([#20846][_#20846])  # Most of the removals are the past 3-4 months, but some MbT stuff dates back to 2020 but was overlooked previously.
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [geometry,multibody] [geometry] Add Shape::type_name, Shape::to_string, and fmt formatter ([#20870][_#20870])  # Deprecate the (awkward) ShapeName and (unused) ShapeToString reifiers, which were the prior mechanisms to obtain the Shape::type_name and Shape::to_string values. Refactor Shape to use a vtable instead of copying reference-counted std::function objects everywhere. Implementing vtables by hand is confusing and wasteful.
* [newly deprecated] TBD [geometry] Deprecate SceneGraphInspector::Reify ([#20872][_#20872])  # This (untested) sugar is not used anywhere.
* [fix] TBD Allow add_directives of directives including collision filters ([#20757][_#20757])  # * add_collision_filter_group does not permit a scoped name * add_directives has a model_namespace to apply to the included directives, required for flattened directives to satisfy uniqueness. * As a result, add_directives would cause a throw when flattening a dmd file containing add_collision_filter_group, even though that dmd file was valid. * The more correct outcome is to use the add_directives model_namespace when processing filter groups. Therefore: * add_collision_filter_group gains an optional model_namespace, normally empty except in flattening. In addition, to manage complexity a bit, the bespoke namespace logic of DMD is promoted to public (at detail level) so that Flatten can make use of it.

* [feature] TBD [common,multibody,geometry] [common] Add Sha256 utility class ([#20779][_#20779])
* [fix] TBD Fix for SchunkWsgTrajectoryGenerator failing on delta=0 ([#20828][_#20828])  # There was a particular set of initial conditions which could cause the trajectory generator to fail, because it passed times=[0, 0, 0] to the PiecewisePolynomial.FirstOrderHold, which then complained about non-increasing times. This PR adds a test which captures the failure, and the fix.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* [fix] TBD Bind Hyperrectangle::MaybeCalcAxisAlignedBoundingBox ([#20804][_#20804])
* [fix] TBD [py geometry] Release the GIL during blocking Meshcat operations ([#20810][_#20810])
* [fix] TBD [pydrake] Release the GIL during "Run" functions ([#20811][_#20811])

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [tools,doc] Build macOS wheels for multiple Python versions ([#20616][_#20616])  # Rework macOS wheel build scripts to use Python-version-specific permanent locations for all operations, with temporary symlinks used for operations shared with the Linux wheel builds that expect non-versioned locations. Also rework builder to support a set of Python targets and to be able to build multiple wheels in a manner similar to how things work for Linux. This changes the macOS wheel build to produce wheels for (as of writing) both Python 3.11 and 3.12.
* [fix] TBD [wheel] Upgrade Eigen to latest release 3.4.0 on Linux ([#20802][_#20802])  # The prior version (3.3.7) is too old for Clarabel. The macOS version is unchanged (remains 3.4.0).
* TBD

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [fix] TBD Bump CRU with fixes for parallel-for exception handling ([#20786][_#20786])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade meshcat to latest commit ([#20805][_#20805])
* [fix] TBD [workspace,tools] [wheel] Enable ClarabelSolver on Linux ([#20802][_#20802])  # Previously, Linux wheels for Python <= 3.11 had it mistakenly disabled.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade crate_universe to latest ([#20814][_#20814])  # Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD [workspace,geometry] Fix bugs in VTK's glTF parser logic ([#20818][_#20818])  # - A material with only non-color textures would ignore its textures. - A material with only non-color textures would erroneously report multiple UV texture coordinate sets. - Warnings in the glTF parser were coded to go straight to the console (no event observer could intervene).
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Remove macOS-specific logic for zlib ([#20829][_#20829])  # The benefit of teaching Bazel exactly which zlib headers XCode will use on macOS isn't worth this much complexity. We're trying to reduce our use of the determine_os() logic to better support more platforms. Rather than rewriting this logic to be safe on additional platforms, it's easier just to toss it.
* [fix] TBD [workspace,geometry] [workspace] Upgrade VTK to latest commit ([#20765][_#20765])  # Remove unnecessary ViewpointUpdate code now that VTK is fixed. Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global> Co-authored-by: Sean Curtis <sean.curtis@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD Update drake_models ([#20858][_#20858])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade VTK to latest commit ([#20867][_#20867])  # Also unpin it so that it will be upgraded every month. This requires adding one more trampoline to the repository rule.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade meshcat to latest commit ([#20876][_#20876])
