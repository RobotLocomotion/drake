# Changes since v0.37.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* TBD [pydrake] Add missing LeafSystem and State bindings ([#16207][_#16207])
* TBD [py/systems] Add missing bindings for LeafSystem::Declare*Event ([#16251][_#16251])
* TBD [systems,examples] [trajectory_optimization] MultipleShooting has-a MathematicalProgram ([#16333][_#16333])  # BREAKING CHANGE.  This PR bends over backwards to deprecate things properly, but there could still be cases for which this is a breaking change.  For instance, if user code creates a cost/constraint class that takes a MathematicalProgram as an argument, it was previously possible to pass a MultipleShooting instance to that method directly. Now you must pass MultipleShooting.prog(). Previously the trajectory optimization base class MultipleShooting derived from MathematicalProgram (MultipleShooting is-a MathematicalProgram).  This PR changes that relationship to MultipleShooting has-a MathematicalProgram (as a member variable). This is the pattern used in much of our other optimization classes, such as InverseKinematics and the Anzu KinematicTrajectoryOptimization.  It has a number of advantages, including the ability, for instance, create multiple trajectory optimization problems in the same mathematical program.

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* TBD AddL2NormCostUsingConicConstraint ([#16208][_#16208])  # Add the L2NormCost using a slack variable with linear cost and LorentzConeConstraint. This is suitable for conic optimization solvers (Gurobi/Mosek/SCS)
* TBD Add AddNonnegativePolynomialConstraint function ([#16289][_#16289])  # * Add polynomial type to AddSosConstraint function. MathematicalProgram can add different types of sos polynomial constraint with the same API.
* TBD Add UpdateCoefficients to (rotated)LorentzConeConstraint ([#16297][_#16297])
* TBD Return the new cost and slack variables from AddMaximizeLogDeterminantSymmetricMatrixCost ([#16296][_#16296])
* TBD [solvers,geometry] Rename to AddMaximizeLogDeterminantCost ([#16309][_#16309])
* TBD [solvers,geometry] Add L1NormCost and LInfNormCost to GraphOfConvexSets cost options ([#16334][_#16334])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD Remove errant comma when writing a RotationalInertia ([#16222][_#16222])  # Co-authored-by: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* TBD [pydrake] Bind some hydroelastic-related classes and functions ([#16219][_#16219])
* TBD [multibody,geometry,examples] [hydro] Rename public API and SDF/URDF tags to use "compliant" for "soft" ([#16224][_#16224])  # - AddSoftHydroelasticProperties() becomes AddCompliantHydroelasticProperties(). - SDF/URDF tag drake:soft_hydroelastic becomes drake:compliant_hydroelastic. - Miscellaneous changes from "soft*" to "compliant*" in non-internal code.
* TBD [hydro, multibody] Add public API to choose triangles or polygons ([#16238][_#16238])  # Relevant to: #15796 - Add C++ API on MultibodyPlant: - get/set_contact_surface_representation(). - static GetDefaultContactSurfaceRepresentation(). - Update MultibodyPlantConfig - Add python bindings - Add tests for above co-authored by: DamrongGuoy
* TBD [meshcat] Add sleep to Meshcat::Flush() ([#16256][_#16256])  # While using Meshcat::Flush() in my experiments, I saw the dreaded "you should never see this message" message. After even more reading of the uWebsockets code, it seems that drainage is not actually scheduled to occur between loop->defer calls. My attempts to request drainage directly also failed. I believe there are no better mechanisms available in the public API than to simply sleep. I've documented my attempts directly in the code.
* TBD [multibody] Prohibit SDFormat/URDF tag drake:soft_hydroelastic ([#16249][_#16249])  # - Require drake:compliant_hydroelastic instead of drake:soft_hydroelastic.
* TBD [meshcat] Add option to disable SetTransform during recording ([#16271][_#16271])  # Related to #16265
* TBD [geometry,tools] [geometry:optimization] Add VPolytope from HPolyhedron ([#16272][_#16272])  # - Brings in qhull as an external. - Adds an implementation for generating VPolytope from HPolyhedron using qhull Co-authored-by: Mark Petersen <markpetersen@g.harvard.edu> Co-authored-by: Tobia Marcucci <tobiam@mit.edu>
* TBD Mbt GetByName() heap alloc fix ([#16303][_#16303])  # Eliminate unnecessary heap allocation in MultibodyTree::GetElementByName(). Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global> Co-authored-by: Rick Poyner <rick.poyner@tri.global>
* TBD [geometry] Take care of centroids of zero-area polygons in PolygonSurfaceMesh ([#16257][_#16257])  # - Use the arithmetic-average position for each zero-area polygon to avoid division by zero from area-weighted-average of sub-triangles' centroids.
* TBD Enable removing Vertices and Edges from GraphOfConvexSets ([#16299][_#16299])
* TBD [plant] Remove deprecated code 2022-01 ([#16329][_#16329])
* TBD [multibody] Add unit inertia for ellipsoid ([#16349][_#16349])
