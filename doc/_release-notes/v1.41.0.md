# Announcements

# Breaking changes since v1.40.0

* TBD

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Changes since v1.40.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* Add DiscreteTimeApproximation for converting general continuous-time systems ([#22652][_#22652])
* Support symbolic scalar type integrators in DiscreteTimeApproximation ([#22913][_#22913])
* Add scalar conversion for Saturation ([#22934][_#22934])

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->


New features

* Add ProjectedGradientDescentSolver ([#22947][_#22947])

Fixes

* IpoptSolver accepts integers for floating-point options ([#22927][_#22927])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->


New features

* Enable reverse revolute joints and add tests ([#22883][_#22883])
* Allow reversed prismatic joints ([#22949][_#22949])

Fixes


## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Set sparsity pattern for KinematicTrajectoryOptimization effort bounds ([#22912][_#22912])
* [newly deprecated] TBD [planning,systems,solvers,multibody] Remove deprecated API 2025-05 ([#22938][_#22938])
* [fix feature] TBD Factor Out Common Options Between IRIS-ZO and IRIS-NP2 ([#22982][_#22982])  # This moves options that are intended to be common to both IRIS-ZO and IRIS-NP2 into a single class, CommonIrisOptions. It also separates out the parameterization functionality. We also update the default value of max_separating_planes_per_iteration per current best practices, and reorganize the constructors and methods of IrisParameterizationFunction for better consistency. Finally, we include two fixes: * Fix an issue with how the "note" block regarding GIL is rendered in the pydrake documentation. * Fix a bindings bug where an InverseKinematics object may be deleted while its subsidiary MathematicalProgram is still being used, leading to a segmentation fault.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* Overload `ExtractValue` and `ExtractGradient` to allow preallocated output matrix ([#22895][_#22895])
* Add more IiwaDriver config options ([#22916][_#22916])

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->


New features

* Add bindings for `drake::manipulation::schunk_wsg::SchunkWsgTrajectoryGenerator` ([#22900][_#22900])
* Add bindings for `drake::solvers::ProjectedGradientDescentSolver` ([#22986][_#22986])

Fixes

* Accept pathlib.Path for paths in pydrake.multibody.parsing.{Parser.AddModels, LoadModelDirectives} ([#22936][_#22936])

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* Support modern versions of user-provided spdlog in CMake ([#22915][_#22915])
* Switch to libclang-17 on Noble ([#22919][_#22919])  # Reintroduces conditional logic akin to 20732, allowing Jammy to be built with libclang-15 and Noble with libclang-17. This also adds logic so partial installs of GCC 14 which occur outside of Drake (e.g. via installing `emacs`) do not cause unexpected build failures.
* Update CMake versioning policies on for Drake source and installation ([#22898][_#22898])
* Use our bazelversion pin in CMake builds also ([#22901][_#22901])  # Amends 3424937ff398352838c205a75fe809445f76bc11.

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.41.0) named
``drake-1.41.0-{jammy|noble|mac-arm64}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
