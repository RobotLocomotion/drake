title: Drake v0.35.0
released: 2021-10-21
---

# Announcements

* An implementation of [Time Optimal Path Parameterization based on
Reachability Analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338417) (TOPPRA)
has been added to Drake C++ and Python ([#15731][_#15731], [#15799][_#15799])
* SDFormat 1.9 supported ([#15852][_#15852])
    * Provides `//pose[@rotation_format]` attribute to choose between Euler RPY
    or Quaternions for the rotation component. Angles can now be expressed in
    degrees using the `//pose[@degrees = true]` attribute when using Euler RPY.
    * Add a new attribute `//include[@merge]` that allows including nested
    models without introducing new scopes (the contents of the included model
    are moved without any modification to the parent model). (*Note*: This
    currently does not support URDFs parsed via SDFormat composition.)
* This release is the first to include PyPI wheels.
    * Refer to [Installation via Pip](/pip.html) for instructions and known limitations.

# Breaking changes since v0.34.0

* DRAKE_DEFAULT_COPY_AND_MOVE_AND_ASSIGN now detects mis-uses ([#15884][_#15884])
* The lcmt_panda_command message has changed ([#15784][_#15784])
* ScsSolverDetails member fields have changed ([#15886][_#15886])
* The publish period for visualizers (meshcat, drake_visualizer) has changed ([#15850][_#15850]).
* Remove solvers/fast_qp.h and solvers/gurobi_qp.h ([#15817][_#15817])
* Bushing and joint declarations must use frames that have been declared in the same URDF/SDFormat file ([#15941][_#15941])
    * This requires the frame name to be part of the currently parsed model instance, and it allows a model which declares a bushing to be loaded multiple times.
    * Previously, parsing one file could inadvertently reference a frame added by a previous file. Any workflow that relied on that implicit cross-file integration will now break.
