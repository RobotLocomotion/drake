# Breaking changes since v0.21.0

* drake::multibody::Joint gained a new pure virtual method do_set_default_positions ([#13757][_#13757])
* pydrake's deprecation infrastructure now must always be given a removal date, either embedded in the message or via the new date= kwarg ([#13730][_#13730])
* Several stale forks of SDFormat models were removed from the Atlas example ([#13758][_#13758])
