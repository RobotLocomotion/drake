# Announcements

* A MultibodyPlant running in discrete-time mode now uses sampled output ports
  ([#21623][_#21623]).
  * This is a major change to the output ports of a discrete-time MultibodyPlant
    for dynamics outputs (forces, accelerations, contacts, etc.). The kinematics
    outputs (positions, velocities, poses, etc.) are unchanged. Refer to the new
    plant API documentation titled "Discrete system dynamics" and "Output port
    sampling" for details.
  * A quick summary of major impacts:
    * By default, a discrete-time MultibodyPlant now has extra abstract State in
      the Context to support the sampling. If you need a minimal-state
      representation for motion planning, optimization, etc. then you can set
      the config option ``use_sampled_output_ports=false``, or use a
      continuous-time plant instead.
    * By default, setting the positions of a discrete-time plant in the Context
      will not have any effect on the dynamics-related output ports, e.g., the
      contact results will not change. If you need to see changes to outputs
      without stepping the plant, then you can set the config option
      ``use_sampled_output_ports=false``, or use a continuous-time plant
      instead. Or, you can call ``ExecuteForcedEvents()`` to force a dynamics
      step and then the outputs will change.
	* Simulations that use the dynamics output ports (e.g., that visualize
      contact results, or report external torques) will run substantially
      faster.
    * The port semantics now have a solid mathematical foundation. Previously,
      they were pseudo-sampled in a way that traded off correctness for
      speed. This new implementation is both faster and more correct.
* Some significant bugs are fixed in `solvers::OsqpSolver` and
  `solvers::MosekSolver` ([#21579][_#21579]).
  * A parsing bug in `OsqpSolver` which sometimes led to the wrong optimization
    program being solved by OsqpSolver.  Valid programs encountering this bug
    would have **silently solved the incorrect problem**. This bug might show
    up for quadratic programs with cross terms in the quadratic cost.
  * A parsing bug in `OsqpSolver` which sometimes led to the error `ERROR in
    validate_data: P is not upper triangular`. Valid programs encountering this
    bug would have had their `result.get_solution_result()` set to
    `InvalidInput` and not solved.
  * A parsing bug in `MosekSolver` which sometimes led to the error `MOSEK
    error 1415 (MSK_RES_ERR_QOBJ_UPPER_TRIANGLE): Only elements in the lower
    triangle of the quadratic term in the objective should be specified`. Valid
    programs encountering this bug would have had their
    `result.get_solution_result()` set to `SolverSpecificError` and not solved.



# Breaking changes since v1.30.0

* MultibodyPlant running in discrete-time mode now uses sampled output ports
  ([#21623][_#21623]).
  * This might require a few config tweaks or adjustments in your code.
  * See the announcement above for details.
* ``ContactResults`` no longer reports hydroelasatic quadrature data
  ([#21683][_#21683]).
* ``HydroelasticContactInfo<Expression>`` is now empty ([#21618][_#21618])
  * Now it only provides for the default lifecycle operations (default
    constructor, destructor, copy, move, assign) but no longer has any
    accessors. (They were already vacuously empty, even previously.)

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
