on API changes.

# Changes since v1.17.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* [newly deprecated] TBD Rename timestep => time_step in systems/primitives ([#19475][_#19475])  # Towards #9661.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [newly deprecated] TBD Rename SolutionResult::kUnknownError to kSolverSpecificError ([#19450][_#19450])  # I had a student trip on this; it was incredibly frustrating to be working on a mathematical program only to have the solver apparently return "kUnknownError".  What they needed, instead, was a hint that they should look at the solver details, etc, to figure out the error. Reformat docstrings so that the actually show up in pydrake. Add deprecation marker (and test) for C++. Restore pydrake binding with deprecation documentation.
* [fix] TBD [solvers,planning] [osqp_solver] Allow for primal-only warm-start ([#19499][_#19499])  # This requires more iterations than warm-starting from primal+dual, but still appears better than solving from scratch kinematic_trajectory_optimization: Relax tolerance for constraint check

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [breaking change] TBD Rename fields in HPolyhedron::Serialize to match convention ([#19469][_#19469])
* [fix] TBD Fix warning when ball joint has an axis ([#18966][_#18966])
* [fix] TBD Implement SapHolonomicConstraint in terms of new APIs introduced in #19402 ([#19493][_#19493])  # The new implementation fixes a bug in the functional form of the cost, making it consistent with its analytical gradient and Hessian. This bug would only appear in holononimic constraints with impulse limits, such as joint stiction and PD control with limits. Given we haven't made those features available in master yet, no one using public APIs (rather than internal:: source) was affected by it. Still, we decided to label this PR as a +fix to keep a record of it.
* [none fix] TBD [examples] Fix contact visualization of contact_surface_rigid_bowl_soft_ball ([#19505][_#19505])

New features

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [newly deprecated] TBD Rename timestep => time_step throughout trajectory optimization ([#19470][_#19470])  # Towards #9661.
* [fix] TBD Fix caching for autodiff in direct collocation ([#19468][_#19468])  # My previous attempt at caching failed to address the fact that the autodiff gradients would be different when the status/inputs were passed in different places inside the variable list for the constraint. Now we implement the chain rule locally so that the cache is kept warm with gradients only with respect to the current variables. Resolves #19396.

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [examples] Use modern Meshcat visualization in spatula_slip_control ([#19461][_#19461])
* [none fix] TBD [examples,multibody] Fix some xml file typos ([#19487][_#19487])  # ... found while developing an XML inertia fixer tool.
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Add binary operator overloads for Polynomial bop Expression ([#19457][_#19457])
* [removal of deprecated] TBD [manipulation,planning,common,multibody,solvers,geometry,systems,tools] Remove deprecated code 2023-06 ([#19516][_#19516])
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* [feature] TBD JointActuator Python bindings for rotor inertias ([#19509][_#19509])
* [feature] TBD Python bind RotationalInertia::CalcPrincipalMomentsAndAxesOfInertia() ([#19521][_#19521])  # * fix CI * code format

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.18.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{focal|jammy|mac|mac-arm64}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
