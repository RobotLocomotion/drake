# Changes since v1.0.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* TBD [systems/analysis] Implements RegionOfAttraction for implicit dynamics ([#16704][_#16704])  # This PR moves one step closer to support RegionOfAttraction analysis of MultibodyPlant systems. MultibodyPlant systems introduce two additional complexities: (1) the dynamics are trigonometric + polynomial, and (2) the dynamics are rational.  This PR adds support for (2).  Support for (1) will come in the follow-up, incorporating #16690.
* TBD [systems,multibody] [systems/analysis] Deprecate InitialValueProblem OdeContext ([#16739][_#16739])  # Previously, InitialValueProblem and its wrappers (ScalarInitialValueProblem, AntiderivativeFunction) all invented new structures called __Context to accept their arguments.  But these structures do not provide the Context API.  Furthermore, they are trivially small wrappers which aren't needed and required a bunch of error checking. This has always bugged me, but I decided to fix it now before adding python bindings for InitialValueProblem and friends -- I'd rather not let the OdeContext, etc, sneak into the pydrake API if I planned to deprecate it eventually. Discussed previously in #12857. Forks some unit tests as of 1504b28.
* TBD [systems,common] [controllers] Implements the square-root form of finite-horizon LQR ([#16812][_#16812])  # * [controllers] Implements the square root form of finite horizon LQR Also implements transpose() in PiecewisePolynomial, which makes the LQR code cleaner. These methods are needed to use time-varying LQR on the perching glider example, and are generally good to have.  The equations are documented at the end of section 8.2.1 in http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/lqr.html .
* TBD [trajopt] Add `MultipleShooting::AddConstraintToAllKnotPoints` variants ([#16847][_#16847])  # This significantly improves the ergonomics in pydrake for adding, for instance, bounding box constraints to the state or input at all knot points.  (And it resolves a long-standing TODO in `multiple_shooting.h`).

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* TBD [solvers,tools] [workspace] Upgrade scs to latest release 3.2.0 ([#16686][_#16686])  # Loosen test tolerances to still pass.
* TBD [solvers,tools] [solvers] In CsdpSolver, use longjmp to avoid full-program exits ([#16736][_#16736])
* TBD [solvers] Combine MathematicalProgram::AddConstraint overloads ([#16778][_#16778])  # A single overload is sufficient for both Matrix<Formula> or Array<Formula>. This reduces documentation and maintenance burden. Remove two dead private helper functions on MathematicalProgram. Also combine internal::ParseConstraint overloads and move the remaining implementation into cc file per GSG.
* TBD ParseConstraint throws error for false formula ([#16813][_#16813])
* TBD Rename NonsmoothAugmentedLagrangian to AugmentedLagrangianNonsmooth ([#16798][_#16798])  # It is hard to search the previous name in doxygen.
* TBD MathematicalProgram ignores the constraint if it were empty ([#16825][_#16825])  # Use CheckBinding to encapsulate triviality checks (#25)
* TBD ParseConstraint ignores formula being always true ([#16854][_#16854])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD [geometry] Fix Meshcat crash on unknown message ([#16703][_#16703])  # Improve unit test tooling to tickle this kind of bug. Add more text logging to help uncover any socket issues.
* TBD New Frame methods CalcRelativeSpatialVelocity() and CalcRelativeSpatialVelocityInWorld() to address part of issue #16189 ([#16691][_#16691])
* TBD [geometry] Fix Meshcat crash with duplicated controls names ([#16726][_#16726])  # When asked to add a control with a duplicate name, throw an exception instead of trying to implicitly delete the existing control. Deleting the existing control never worked anyway; it was checking for duplicates using the moved-from name, which was always empty. This led to duplicate names in the controls_ vector, and then segfaults. Add more internal assertions that the controls_ vector is congruent with the buttons_ and sliders_ vectors.
* TBD Add ability to create a VPolytope from a non-minimal set of vertices ([#16729][_#16729])
* TBD [geometry] Be sure to print exceptions from Meshcat's worker thread ([#16659][_#16659])  # Without this, exceptions that leak back to std::thread end up in std::terminate and usually won't show up for Python. With this, exceptions will be logged immediately and any additional calls on the Meshcat object will throw an exception.
* TBD [parsing] Remove deprecated `drake:elastic_modulus` ([#16786][_#16786])  # The deprecation began during the "hydro is experimental" period, so wasn't done formally with announcements in release notes, etc. However, the advertised deprecation period has elapsed. It can go.
* TBD [multibody,tools] [multibody] Install deprecated contact_results_to_meshcat.h header ([#16789][_#16789])  # This fixes an omission from 8b96d899578e5d7f2059e9a991ecc9e4b1a393ea. Also add an SAP solver package_library, to de-chaff the install list.
* TBD [geometry] Repeated Meshcat::AddButton calls reset the click count ([#16808][_#16808])
* TBD Adds compliant convex mesh support ([#16753][_#16753])  # Adds Convex to the supported list of compliant shape types.
* TBD [multibody,tools] [parsing] Route SDFormat warnings through DiagnosticPolicy ([#16819][_#16819])  # This will allow us to more easily toggle their strictness.
* TBD Update SpatialAcceleration methods to parallel SpatialVelocity ([#16699][_#16699])  # Update SpatialAcceleration methods to parallel SpatialVelocity Co-authored-by: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* TBD PlanarSceneGraphVisualizer now uses VPolytope::GetMinimalRepresentation to compute the convex hull ([#16765][_#16765])
* TBD [parsing] Use DiagnosticPolicy in ResolveUri ([#16820][_#16820])
* TBD Create new method Frame::CalcSpatialAcceleration() and improve related documentation and tests ([#16760][_#16760])
* TBD [multibody] Add `MultibodyPlant::GetEffortLowerLimits` (and friends) ([#16835][_#16835])

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* TBD [manipulation_station] Remove the camera mesh from self-perception ([#16754][_#16754])  # The camera should not be visible to itself or else it obscures its own view. We only want the illustration properties so that the camera shows up in the visualizer.
* TBD Remove uses of interactive matplotlib from tutorials to support deepnote/colab ([#16837][_#16837])
* TBD [tutorials,doc] [doc] Switch tutorial links to point to Deepnote ([#16860][_#16860])
* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* TBD [common] Add support for SinCosSubstitution in Expression ([#16690][_#16690])
* TBD [symbolic] ToLatex displays matrix/vector variables using subscript for indices ([#16720][_#16720])
* TBD [manipulation,examples,tools] [examples] Add realsense camera geometries to manipulation station ([#16719][_#16719])  # Add mesh decimation option to stl2obj, and use it to reduce the realsense mesh from 20760 KB to 840 KB.
* TBD [common,solvers] [common] Deprecate TrigPoly ([#16741][_#16741])  # Our symbolic::Expression can do this work, too, now, and with Expression we can process trigonometric polynomials directly from MultibodyPlant. The SystemIdentification pipeline goes out along with it.  We can do better with symbolic::Expression now.
* TBD [yaml] Extract Options struct out of YamlReadArchive ([#16801][_#16801])  # This is cleaner for users, and is a prerequisite of moving the archive classes to an internal namespace.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD [pydrake] add bindings for BsplineBasis::EvaluateCurve ([#16721][_#16721])
* TBD [pydrake] Add bindings for SimulatorConfig, MultibodyPlantConfig ([#16717][_#16717])  # * [pydrake] Add Add bindings for SimulatorConfig, MultibodyPlantConfig Add bindings for functions that operate on them: AddMultibodyPlant, ApplySimulatorConfig, ExtractSimulatorConfig. Use DefAttributesUsingSerialize in pydrake.common.schema for consistency.
* TBD [pydrake] Ensure GIL is locked when logging from a C++ worker thread ([#16724][_#16724])  # To avoid lock order inversion, we must avoid using any mutexes in the spdlog code paths; instead we should grab the GIL once we've reached the Python sink. This means that users will not be able to log to both a C++ sink and Python sink anymore. Users who want to do so can configure logging on their own, in which case Drake's logging reconfiguration will leave it unchanged.
* TBD [pydrake] StartMeshcat uses NginX when on Deepnote ([#16805][_#16805])  # Refactor ngrok support into its own helper function. Display the URL using a clickable link.
* TBD Python bindings for LcmPublisherSystem and Simulator ([#16762][_#16762])  # Bind `LcmPublisherSystem.Make(*, publish_triggers)` and `Simulator.set_publish_at_initialization` Add kwargs for `Simulator.{set_publish_every_time_step,set_target_realtime_rate,}` Co-authored-by: Eric Cousineau <eric.cousineau@tri.global>
* TBD [pydrake] Remove stray print in StartMeshcat ([#16830][_#16830])  # The logger is already printing the URL (and this string lacked the f-string substitution in any case). Also restore the prior set_log_level behavior during ngrok setup.
* TBD [pydrake] Stub out scipy.sparse for unit testing ([#16840][_#16840])  # In order to reduce our install footprint, pydrake will no longer depend on scipy on or after 2022-07-01. Any users of the few scipy.sparse-returning methods in pydrake will need to add a direct dependency onto scipy to their own projects. The methods that return a sparse matrix will raise an ImportError when they are called when scipy is not installed.

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* TBD [third_party,tools,common,setup,examples] [workspace] Build yaml-cpp from source ([#16701][_#16701])  # Upgrade to use 0.7.0 on all platforms.
* TBD [pydrake] Add DefAttributesUsingSerialize helper function ([#16718][_#16718])  # This binds the fields of a Serialize-able struct automatically.
* TBD [third_party,tools,common,setup,examples] Revert "[workspace] Build yaml-cpp from source" ([#16728][_#16728])  # This reverts commit 62ce208922f4a192f74c67dc655cf52a07e1011f.
* TBD [tools,third_party,common,examples] [workspace] Build yaml-cpp from source ([#16756][_#16756])  # Upgrade to use 0.7.0 on all platforms. This reverts commit a1baff7f4c4f87e23a3517b3974240d405f6ab60, effectively re-applying 62ce208922f4a192f74c67dc655cf52a07e1011f but with heavy edits in support of a better deprecation path.
* TBD Enable split debug symbols on Ubuntu ([#16587][_#16587])
* TBD [tools] Don't enable (split) debug symbols in release builds ([#16788][_#16788])  # This partially reverts cdd6652095c356f9c48b49fde60fbe392e465960.
* TBD [tools,solvers,doc] upgrade gurobi to 9.5.1 (which includes macos arm64 support) ([#16716][_#16716])
* TBD CMake: Update Guorbi version in FindGurobi module ([#16794][_#16794])
* TBD [tools,multibody] [workspace] Don't build libsdformat's URDF parser ([#16772][_#16772])  # Drake has its own URDF parser that we must always use, so we should disable transmogrification of URDF files into SDFormat files. Don't generate sdf/sdf.hh; it's only effect is IWYU violations.
* TBD [tools,multibody] [parsing] Stop using mutable globals ([#16791][_#16791])
* TBD CMake: Update gurobi install directory on Mac ([#16803][_#16803])
* TBD [tools,geometry,common,multibody,systems] [tools] Add interface_deps option to drake_cc_library ([#16787][_#16787])  # This provides an #include firewall for dependent headers only used by srcs. The example provided here is //common:filesystem which is not installed so generally should be firewalled off.
* TBD [tools,systems] [workspace] Add abseil-cpp dependency ([#16774][_#16774])  # As a demonstration and proof of life, use it to make CalcNextUpdateTime typically heapless. Add a linting rule to enforce an allow-list for third-party code used by interface deps.
* TBD [geometry:drake_visualizer] Fix for disabling/enabling hydro contact plugin ([#16852][_#16852])  # Fix for disabling/enabling hydro contact plugin
* TBD
