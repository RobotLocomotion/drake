## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* TBD [third_party,tools,common,setup,examples] [workspace] Build yaml-cpp from source ([#16701][_#16701])  # Upgrade to use 0.7.0 on all platforms.
* TBD [pydrake] Add DefAttributesUsingSerialize helper function ([#16718][_#16718])  # This binds the fields of a Serialize-able struct automatically.
* TBD [third_party,tools,common,setup,examples] Revert "[workspace] Build yaml-cpp from source" ([#16728][_#16728])  # This reverts commit 62ce208922f4a192f74c67dc655cf52a07e1011f.
* TBD [tools,third_party,common,examples] [workspace] Build yaml-cpp from source ([#16756][_#16756])  # Upgrade to use 0.7.0 on all platforms. This reverts commit a1baff7f4c4f87e23a3517b3974240d405f6ab60, effectively re-applying 62ce208922f4a192f74c67dc655cf52a07e1011f but with heavy edits in support of a better deprecation path.
* TBD Enable split debug symbols on Ubuntu ([#16587][_#16587])
* TBD [tools] Don't enable (split) debug symbols in release builds ([#16788][_#16788])  # This partially reverts cdd6652095c356f9c48b49fde60fbe392e465960.
* TBD [tools,solvers,doc] upgrade gurobi to 9.5.1 (which includes macos arm64 support) ([#16716][_#16716])
* TBD CMake: Update Gurobi version in FindGurobi module ([#16794][_#16794])
* TBD [tools,multibody] [workspace] Don't build libsdformat's URDF parser ([#16772][_#16772])  # Drake has its own URDF parser that we must always use, so we should disable transmogrification of URDF files into SDFormat files. Don't generate sdf/sdf.hh; it's only effect is IWYU violations.
* TBD [tools,multibody] [parsing] Stop using mutable globals ([#16791][_#16791])
* TBD CMake: Update gurobi install directory on Mac ([#16803][_#16803])
* TBD [tools,geometry,common,multibody,systems] [tools] Add interface_deps option to drake_cc_library ([#16787][_#16787])  # This provides an #include firewall for dependent headers only used by srcs. The example provided here is //common:filesystem which is not installed so generally should be firewalled off.
* TBD [tools,systems] [workspace] Add abseil-cpp dependency ([#16774][_#16774])  # As a demonstration and proof of life, use it to make CalcNextUpdateTime typically heapless. Add a linting rule to enforce an allow-list for third-party code used by interface deps.
* TBD [geometry:drake_visualizer] Fix for disabling/enabling hydro contact plugin ([#16852][_#16852])  # Fix for disabling/enabling hydro contact plugin
* TBD [multibody,tools] [multibody] Install deprecated contact_results_to_meshcat.h header ([#16789][_#16789])  # This fixes an omission from 8b96d899578e5d7f2059e9a991ecc9e4b1a393ea. Also add an SAP solver package_library, to de-chaff the install list.
* TBD

## Build dependencies

<!-- Manually relocate any "Upgrade foo_external to latest" lines to here, -->
<!-- and then sort them alphabetically. -->

* Upgrade scs to latest release 3.2.0 ([#16686][_#16686])

## Newly-deprecated APIs

* TBD (also new api) [systems,multibody] [systems/analysis] Deprecate InitialValueProblem OdeContext ([#16739][_#16739])
* TBD Rename NonsmoothAugmentedLagrangian to AugmentedLagrangianNonsmooth ([#16798][_#16798])  # It is hard to search the previous name in doxygen.
* TBD [common,solvers] [common] Deprecate TrigPoly ([#16741][_#16741])  # Our symbolic::Expression can do this work, too, now, and with Expression we can process trigonometric polynomials directly from MultibodyPlant. The SystemIdentification pipeline goes out along with it.  We can do better with symbolic::Expression now.
* TBD [pydrake] Stub out scipy.sparse for unit testing ([#16840][_#16840])  # In order to reduce our install footprint, pydrake will no longer depend on scipy on or after 2022-07-01. Any users of the few scipy.sparse-returning methods in pydrake will need to add a direct dependency onto scipy to their own projects. The methods that return a sparse matrix will raise an ImportError when they are called when scipy is not installed.

## Removal of deprecated items

* TBD
* TBD [parsing] Remove deprecated `drake:elastic_modulus` ([#16786][_#16786])  # The deprecation began during the "hydro is experimental" period, so wasn't done formally with announcements in release notes, etc. However, the advertised deprecation period has elapsed. It can go.

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.1.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{bionic|focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
