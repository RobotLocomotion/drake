# Announcements

* TBD
* Drake Gym something something ([#19831][_#19831])

# Breaking changes since v1.19.0

* [breaking change feature] TBD [systems,geometry] CameraConfig can use RenderEngineParams ([#19863][_#19863])  # Previously, the nature of the render engine was given by a single string: naming the render engine class to use. It makes the RenderEngine impossible to configure. This extends the `renderer_class` field to also take instances of the various RenderEngine*Params structs. Now the engines can be fully specified in yaml. This also extends the set of renderer classes to include GltfClient. Updated the documentation on CameraConfig::background to clarify its scope in the new world.
* [breaking change] TBD [solvers,planning] Removes VertexId and EdgeId overloads from GraphOfConvexSets API ([#19825][_#19825])  # BREAKING CHANGE. The class is marked experimental, so some changes are made without deprecation. - Deprecated the VertexId and EdgeId overloads. In particular, python users should get a useful message telling them to use the other overload. - AddEdge, RemoveVertex, and RemoveEdge have changed (without deprecation) from taking `const Vertex&` to `Vertex*`. The previous constness was a lie. This change will not impact python users.
* [breaking change] TBD Remove CIrisSeparatingPlane ([#19756][_#19756])  # Remove CIrisSeparatingPlane, and only uses the parent CSpaceSeparatingPlane class. This is a breaking change as 1. The return type of CspaceFreePolytopeBase::separating_planes() is changed from CIrisSeparatingPlane to CSpaceSeparatingPlane. 2. We removed CIrisSeparatingPlane class.
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD Add SpatialInertia::SolidCylinderWithMassAboutEnd() ([#19803][_#19803])  # In support of the SpatialInertia function, the corresponding UnitInertia API has changed to support cylinders with arbitrary axis orientation. This required deprecating the old API in favor of the new. Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [geometry] Deprecate RenderEngineGl's default_label option ([#19912][_#19912])  # Unfortunately, it's not possible to mark it with DRAKE_DEPRECATED due to warnings from the implicitly-generated default constructor. Switch the default default_label to kDontCare. Drop default_label from Serialize(), which means that the params are compatible now with YAML serialization.
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [geometry] Deprecate RenderEngineGltfClient's default_label option ([#19906][_#19906])  # Unfortunately, it's not possible to mark it with DRAKE_DEPRECATED due to warnings from the implicitly-generated default constructor. Switch the default default_label to kDontCare. The only two permitted choices are kDontCare or kUnspecified; the RenderLabel docs disavow kUnspecified, and the Drake RPC already prefers kDontCare. Drop default_label from Serialize(), which means that the params are compatible now with YAML serialization.
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [geometry] Deprecate RenderEngineVtk's default_label option ([#19911][_#19911])  # Unfortunately, it's not possible to mark it with DRAKE_DEPRECATED due to warnings from the implicitly-generated default constructor. Switch the default default_label to kDontCare. Drop default_label from Serialize(), which means that the params are compatible now with YAML serialization.

# Changes since v1.19.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* [feature] TBD [systems,planning] Add SimulatorConfig support to FiniteHorizonLQR ([#19765][_#19765])  # This enables, for instance, setting the integrator parameters used for solving the Riccati equation. Motivated by this stackoverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76463931/python-scipt-killed-by-oom-during-finitehorizonlinearquadraticregulator-is-this/76675043#76675043
* [feature] TBD [systems] Add optional publish_offset to LcmPublisherSystem ([#19899][_#19899])
* [feature] TBD [sensors] Add capture_offset and output_delay to CameraConfig ([#19898][_#19898])
* [breaking change feature] TBD [systems,geometry] CameraConfig can use RenderEngineParams ([#19863][_#19863])  # Previously, the nature of the render engine was given by a single string: naming the render engine class to use. It makes the RenderEngine impossible to configure. This extends the `renderer_class` field to also take instances of the various RenderEngine*Params structs. Now the engines can be fully specified in yaml. This also extends the set of renderer classes to include GltfClient. Updated the documentation on CameraConfig::background to clarify its scope in the new world.

Fixes

* [fix] TBD [framework] Improve DiagramBuilder::Build performance ([#19746][_#19746])  # When searching the Diagram feedthrough graph, only ever ask each subsystem for its own feedthrough graph at most once.
* [fix] TBD [framework] Fix wrong SystemId on the ports of a cloned system ([#19875][_#19875])
* [fix] TBD Allow GetDowncastSubsystemByName to work with non-templatized system ([#19925][_#19925])  # Diagram already supports this. This gives DiagramBuilder the analogous functionality. In contrast with Diagram, this uses the hypothesis that the extra C++ plumbing doesn't need to be documented in doxygen.

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

New features

* [feature] TBD Add GraphOfConvexSets::SolveConvexRestriction() ([#19785][_#19785])
* [feature] TBD Adds MathematicalProgramResult::SetSolution() ([#19790][_#19790])  # This only supports the narrow case where the decision variable indices do not change. But it is very helpful for, e.g., writing test cases for methods that must extract context from a MathematicalProgramResult. Previously, the only alternative was to set the entire vector each time.
* [feature] TBD Add MathematicalProgramResult::get_decision_variable_index() ([#19814][_#19814])  # This enables, for instance, callers that want to add new variables to an existing MathematicalProgramResult (who can get the current index, add to it, and then set_decision_variable_index()).
* [feature] TBD [solvers,planning] Adds GraphOfConvexSets::GetSolutionPath() and supporting introspection methods ([#19792][_#19792])  # And use it in GcsTrajectoryOptimization. Also adds introspection methods that curate the incoming and outgoing edges from a vertex.
* [feature] TBD Implement MaybeGetFeasiblePoint for ConvexSet and add test cases for all derived classes ([#19804][_#19804])
* [feature] TBD Update ConvexSet logic to properly handle zero-dimensional sets, and whether or not they're empty ([#19732][_#19732])
* [feature] TBD Use GraphOfConvexSets::SolveConvexRestriction in rounding ([#19816][_#19816])  # Also fixes SolveConvexRestriction to properly rewrite the convex costs into constriants (with slack variables) to be supported by the convex solvers. Previously it could call SNOPT instead of, e.g., Mosek.
* [feature] TBD Better implementations of DoMaybeGetFeasiblePoint for some subclasses of ConvexSet ([#19824][_#19824])  # fixup private doxygen
* [feature] TBD [solvers,geometry] IrisInConfigurationSpace: Reuse counter-examples from the previous iteration ([#19835][_#19835])  # This also allows us to reduce the num_collision_infeasible_samples default, as is demonstrated by the unit tests (which no longer need the large non-default options to pass). Running the Iris in Configuration Space benchmark shows: Before: ``` -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Benchmark                                          Time             CPU -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IiwaWithShelvesAndBins/GenerateAllRegions       1081 s          1081 s ``` After: ``` -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Benchmark                                          Time             CPU -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IiwaWithShelvesAndBins/GenerateAllRegions        547 s           547 s ```
* [feature] TBD Creates AffineSubspace subclass of ConvexSet ([#19828][_#19828])
* [feature] TBD Implements Hyperellipsoid::MinimumVolumeCircumscribedEllipsoid ([#19857][_#19857])  # Also known as the "outer Loewner-John" ellipsoid.
* [feature] TBD Implement AffineSubspace methods to check containment and equivalence ([#19850][_#19850])
* [feature] TBD Implement change of coordinates functionality for AffineSubspace ([#19851][_#19851])
* [feature] TBD Implement a constructor for AffineSubspace that gets the affine hull of another ConvexSet ([#19864][_#19864])
* [feature] TBD Create base-class version for IsBounded in ConvexSet, and let Intersection and Spectrahedron use it ([#19888][_#19888])
* [feature] TBD [solvers,tutorials] Implements MathematicalProgram::ToLatex() ([#19942][_#19942])

Fixes

* [fix] TBD Handle bounding box constraints in MakeSemidefiniteRelaxation ([#19795][_#19795])
* [fix] TBD Adjust test tolerance for GraphOfConvexSetsTest ([#19801][_#19801])
* [fix] TBD Fix bug in DoAddPointInNonnegativeScalingConstraints for Spectrahedron ([#19838][_#19838])  # class
* [fix] TBD Fix ParseConstraint for cases with infs in rhs or lhs ([#19903][_#19903])  # Previously, cases like ``` b = [0.12, inf] ParseConstraint(x <= b) ``` would fail with ``` abort: Failure at solvers/create_constraint.cc:88 in ParseConstraint(): condition '!std::isnan(new_lb(i))' failed. ``` due to an `inf - inf` situation. Now we handle those cases properly.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

New features

* [feature] TBD [geometry] RenderEngineGl loads .mtl files ([#19747][_#19747])
* [feature] TBD [parsing] Parse custom ball constraint elements ([#19780][_#19780])
* [feature] TBD [geometry,examples] Adds a benchmark for IrisInConfigurationSpace ([#19771][_#19771])  # This benchmark plants a flag before we start optimizing the IrisInConfigurationSpace runtimes.
* [feature] TBD Add lights to RenderEngineGlParams ([#19693][_#19693])  # Adds a lights parameter to RenderEngineGlParams to enable configuration of multiple lights. - Make it all serializable. - Refactor lighting logic in ShaderProgram to facilitate. - Adds "fallback" lighting behavior; the engine's legacy lighting behavior. - Extend Rgba API to facilitate testing - facilitate modulation of a color by a scalar and another rgba and add streaming operator. Co-Authored-By: miceggar <miceggar@amazon.com> Co-Authored-By: Sean Curtis <sean.curtis@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD Construct MinimumDistanceConstraint with a CollisionChecker ([#19760][_#19760])  # We can now compute the distance through CollisionChecker, and then impose bounds on the minimum distance.
* [feature] TBD Meshcat can specify the environment map ([#19837][_#19837])  # Environment maps allow for a higher fidelity of the visualized geometry, particularly useful for objects defined with physically-based rendering (PBR) material properties. This gives the Meshcat class the ability to set and clear such an environment variable (with the attendant bindings). Furthermore, model_visualizer and meldis have been extended to take an optional environment map as a parameter (implicitly testing the bindings). The actual implementation is tested in meshcat_manual_test.cc where an environment gets loaded and then subsequently dismissed.
* [feature] TBD [multibody] Adds active/inactive parameter for SAP constraints ([#19884][_#19884])
* [feature] TBD [multibody,geometry,examples] [multibody] Introduce plant.RenameModelInstance() ([#19939][_#19939])
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD Add SpatialInertia::SolidCylinderWithMassAboutEnd() ([#19803][_#19803])  # In support of the SpatialInertia function, the corresponding UnitInertia API has changed to support cylinders with arbitrary axis orientation. This required deprecating the old API in favor of the new. Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [geometry] Deprecate RenderEngineGl's default_label option ([#19912][_#19912])  # Unfortunately, it's not possible to mark it with DRAKE_DEPRECATED due to warnings from the implicitly-generated default constructor. Switch the default default_label to kDontCare. Drop default_label from Serialize(), which means that the params are compatible now with YAML serialization.
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [geometry] Deprecate RenderEngineGltfClient's default_label option ([#19906][_#19906])  # Unfortunately, it's not possible to mark it with DRAKE_DEPRECATED due to warnings from the implicitly-generated default constructor. Switch the default default_label to kDontCare. The only two permitted choices are kDontCare or kUnspecified; the RenderLabel docs disavow kUnspecified, and the Drake RPC already prefers kDontCare. Drop default_label from Serialize(), which means that the params are compatible now with YAML serialization.
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [geometry] Deprecate RenderEngineVtk's default_label option ([#19911][_#19911])  # Unfortunately, it's not possible to mark it with DRAKE_DEPRECATED due to warnings from the implicitly-generated default constructor. Switch the default default_label to kDontCare. Drop default_label from Serialize(), which means that the params are compatible now with YAML serialization.

Fixes

* [fix] TBD fix names shown off-by-one in RationalForwardKinematics var names ([#19797][_#19797])
* [fix] TBD [geometry] Demote warning message for too many materials ([#19815][_#19815])  # Log at debug level, instead of warning. This condition describes an incomplete implementation within Drake, not something the user can typically do anything about.
* [fix] TBD [geometry] Fix MeshcatVisualizer initialization of alpha slider ([#19813][_#19813])  # When the visualized geometry all has 0% alpha, we need to bump it up to 100% alpha immediately after the geometry is first added, so that the slider value special case for all-zero is in effect even before the user drags the slider at all. This should also fix the gedanken-bug where the alpha slider is <100% and scene graph serial number evolves; in that case, we need to sync again so the demotion is in effect without making the user drags the slider again.
* [fix] TBD Fix to merging gltf in RenderEngineGltfClient ([#19896][_#19896])  # In the previous version, we'd omitted nodes that weren't mesh nodes with the intent of excluding camera nodes. However, this also omitted all "empty" root nodes (neither mesh nor camera). However, glTF defines hierarchies of nodes and it is perfectly reasonable to have an empty node at the root of a hierarchy of meshes. By omitting empty nodes from the set of root nodes, such hierarchies weren't getting properly posed. This now considers all root nodes agnostically, regardless of type, just to be safe.
* [fix] TBD [multibody] Implements SapCouplerConstraint and incorporates it into SapDriver ([#19902][_#19902])  # Also includes a fix for an existing bug in SapDriver::AddCouplerConstraint where the velocity index of a joint was incorrectly used to index the joint's positions.

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* [fix] TBD Cleanup GcsTrajectoryOptimization Subgraph costs and constraints ([#19873][_#19873])  # - Simplifies AddPathLengthCost. - Uses the new BezierCurve method to avoid Expression parsing in AddVelocityBounds (and uses SparseMatrix). - Avoids extraneous placeholder variable manipulation. - Fixes some missing default names.

* [feature] TBD [tools,examples] [pydrake/multibody] Add fix_inertia tool ([#19731][_#19731])
* [fix] TBD Updated inertias for link 2 and link 4 for the iiwas that were rotated by 90 degrees ([#19830][_#19830])
* [fix] TBD [symbolic] Fix integer overflow in ToLatex implementation ([#19951][_#19951])  # Also some nearby cleanups: - Prefer "optional" over "bool success + output argument". - Remove unused precision; ints never have decimals anyway. - Prefer "isinf" over "== numeric_limits::infinity".
* [fix] TBD [common,systems] [yaml] Fix round-trip bugs with variant<string,...> ([#19954][_#19954])
