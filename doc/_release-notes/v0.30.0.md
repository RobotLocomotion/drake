title: Drake v0.30.0
released: 2021-05-17
---

# Announcements

* Drake now provides an Ubuntu APT site that publishes our numbered releases
  ([#15016][_#15016]). Refer to
  [APT Packages for Monthly Tagged Releases][_apt-packages] for instructions.

# Breaking changes since v0.29.0

* On Ubuntu systems, Drake now requires the AVX2 and FMA family of SIMD
  intrinsics, i.e., the Intel's "Broadwell" microarchitecture or newer
  ([#15013][_#15013]).

* Drake now enforces stricter validation of SDFormat input data, so bad files
  that previously parsed without complaint now generate errors. For example,
  the `<pose>` element now has additional syntax checking ([#14852][_#14852]).

* Several methods on drake::systems::Diagram that were erroneously public have
  been made private. The affected methods are DoCalcTimeDerivatives() and
  DoCalcImplicitTimeDerivativesResidual(). Correct code should call
  EvalTimeDerivatives(), CalcTimeDerivatives(), or
  CalcImplicitTimeDerivativesResidual() instead ([#15031][_#15031]).

* Within Drake's event support, the arguments of the rarely-used handle()
  methods of PublishEvent, DiscreteUpdateEvent, and UnrestrictedUpdateEvent
  have changed. All now require a reference to the owning system as the first
  argument ([#14969][_#14969], [#15032][_#15032]).

* Drake no longer supports SDFormat's `<include>` elements. In the future, this
  feature will be restored with revised semantics. If you encounter issues with
  `<include>` elements in the interim, please notify Eric Cousineau.
