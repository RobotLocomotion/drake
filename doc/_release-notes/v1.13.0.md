title: Drake v1.13.0
date: 2099-01-01
released: 2099-01-01
---

# Announcements

* Update macOS to to use python@3.11 ([#18262][_#18262])

# Breaking changes since v1.12.0

* Introduce name mangling for Python template classes ([#18587][_#18587]).
  * For template instantiations, we now use Unicode mangling instead of square
    brackets for the underlying class name, and similarly for commas and periods
    within the template param. Python class names are not allowed to use
    brackets; doing so causes headaches for tools like Mypy.
  * This is breaking change in the sense that the underlying ``cls.__name__``
    will change, which might affect certain kinds of regression tests or
    pickling.
* Remove SortedPair's mutable structured bindings ([#18767][_#18767]).
  * Mutation allows the user to violate the sorting invariant.
* Rename pydrake's symbolic ``FormulaKind.True`` and ``FormulaKind.False``
  ([#18589][_#18589]).
  * The new names are ``FormulaKind.True_`` and ``FormulaKind.False_``.
  * The unadorned ``True`` and ``False`` are reserved words in Python.

## Other important changes

* URDF parsing now respects the ``<mimic/>`` element ([#18728][_#18728]).
  * This will change the MultibodyPlant behavior for models that declared the
    element.
* The manipulation_station example provides an applied_spatial_force_input_port
  ([#18268][_#18268]).
  * Generalized forces due to these externally applied forces are now included
    in the "iiwa_torque_external" output port (this is relevant if a user
    decides to apply non-zero spatial forces and "iiwa_torque_external" is being
    used to only consider contact).

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* (feature) TBD [examples,tutorials,multibody,common] [multibody] Add AddModelsFromUrl function to Parser ([#18692][_#18692])
* (feature) TBD [workspace,geometry,tools] [geometry] Promote RenderEngineGltfClient to public ([#18480][_#18480])
* (feature) TBD [geometry,common] [geometry] Add array-based getters and setters to Rgba ([#18571][_#18571])  # Rewrite serialization to add python bindings. Clean up some recurring code style errors an inconsistencies.
* (feature) TBD Add python binding for RenderEngineGltfClient ([#18387][_#18387])
* (feature) TBD [geometry,workspace] [geometry] RenderEngine can also consume non-uchar-channel textures ([#18410][_#18410])
* (feature) TBD Add more shapes to SpatialInertia factories ([#18483][_#18483])  # Add spatial inertia factory methods for solid box, capsule, cylinder, ellipsoid, sphere.  Add optional unit_vector argument to UnitInertia::SolidCapsule(). Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* (fix) TBD [multibody] Warn when unsupported geometries are parsed from SDFormat ([#18594][_#18594])
* (feature) TBD [multibody,tutorials] [parsing] Add model name prefix constructors to Parser ([#18625][_#18625])
* (feature) TBD Add SAP ball constraint ([#18470][_#18470])
* (fix) TBD [pydrake] Bind all SceneGraph.RemoveRole overloads ([#18645][_#18645])
* (fix) TBD [multibody,examples] Consolidate discrete contact into the discrete manager. Removed unused code from MultibodyPlant ([#18647][_#18647])  # This PR effectively moves the responsibility of computing contact results from MultibodyPlant into the DiscreteUpdateManager. This allows for the consistent computation of contact results according to the underlying contact model (regularization with TAMSI, convex relaxation with SAP). This is done in two parts: 1. TamsiDriver computes a consistent contact Jacobian from the pair kinematics computed by the manager. Therefore now both SAP and TAMSI always use consistent sign conventions hardwired in the Jacobian. 2. Removal of unused Jacobian computation code in the MultibodyPlant.
* (feature) TBD Function to shift a body's center of mass and preserve its central unit inertia ([#18582][_#18582])  # Added documentation to strongly push use towards SetSpatialInertiaInBodyFrame() or the newly added function SetCenterOfMassInBodyFrameAndPreserveCentralInertia()  and away from the old function SetCenterOfMassInBodyFrame() . Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* (feature) TBD Add tetrahedron to SpatialInertia and UnitInertia ([#18618][_#18618])  # Co-Authored-By: mitiguy <paul.mitiguy@tri.global>
* (feature) TBD [geometry,systems,planning] Add Clone support to SceneGraph and RobotDiagram ([#18717][_#18717])  # In support, amend SceneGraph to support AutoDiff-to-double and Expression-to-double scalar conversions. In support, enhance Diagram scalar conversion to allow preserving subtypes even across multiple chained conversions (which is how we implement cloning for systems).
* (fix) TBD [parsing] Fix URDF planar joint support ([#18735][_#18735])
* [feature] TBD [parsing] Add support for URDF mimic element ([#18728][_#18728])
* (fix) TBD [meshcat] Check whether browser supports gamepads ([#18720][_#18720])  # Co-authored-by: Patrick Hammer <hammerpa@amazon.com>
* (feature) TBD [multibody] Allow opt out of adjacent body collision filters ([#18736][_#18736])
* [] TBD [multibody,manipulation,examples,tools] Moving files to new location ([#35cf9631623e10022022777fe2682c8e1e7360a4][_#35cf9631623e10022022777fe2682c8e1e7360a4])  # - manipulation/planner/differential_inverse_kinematics* goes to multibody/inverse_kinematics Moving includes updating all references, namespaces, and bindings.
* (feature) TBD Adding time-varying constraints to two Toppra APIs ([#18738][_#18738])
