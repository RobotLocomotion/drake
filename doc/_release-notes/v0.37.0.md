title: Drake v0.37.0
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* Drake will no longer support Ubuntu 18.04 "Bionic" as of April 1st, 2022
  ([#13391][_#13391]).
  * Ubuntu users should plan to upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal" before that
    time.
  * Drake will add support for Ubuntu 22.04 "Jammy" as soon as possible
    after it's release date, most likely by June 1st, 2022.

* TBD

Fixes

* Improve error message for diagram scalar conversion ([#16131][_#16131])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

Fixes

* TBD

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD Updates MultibodyTreeTopology to sort DOFs in depth-first order rather than breadth-first order ([#16035][_#16035])
* TBD [hydro] Patch triangle surface mesh ([#16112][_#16112])  # Tweaks the triangle surface mesh so that it will be forward compatible with the polygon surface mesh (and incidentally cleans up a formatting issue). 1. SurfaceTriangle can report number of vertices (hard-coded to 3). 2. Can report the centroid of each triangle. 3. The return type for `CalcBarycentric` is properly expressed as the declared barycentric type. This is a cosmetic change here to help it match PolygonSurfaceMesh.
* TBD [geometry,multibody] [hydro] Eliminate representative triangle contact surface ([#16120][_#16120])  # This simply eliminates the tentative API for producing a contact surface with fewer elements. It is being removed so that it doesn't interfere with introducing the polygon surface mesh version of the contact surface. This means, there will temporarily be no "low resolution" contact surface in discrete mode until the PR train outlined in 15796 is completed.
* TBD [hydro] Add the PolygonSurfaceMesh ([#16111][_#16111])  # Like the TriangleSurfaceMesh, it represents a discrete 2D surface. Unlike it, the discrete elements can be polygons with 3 or more sides. It is designed to be basically compatible with TriangleSurfaceMesh. It currently lacks the ability to iterate through faces and vertices via *range* iteration. A TODO calls that missing feature out. Co-authored-by: Joe Masterjohn <joe.masterjohn@tri.global>
* TBD [meshcat] Add Meshcat::StaticHtml() ([#16142][_#16142])  # Adds support for saving the scene (including animations) into a standalone HTML file which can be shared and enjoyed.  It is equivalent to the `static_html()` method from `meshcat-python`.
* TBD [meshcat] Avoid dropping messages due to backpressure, and provide Flush() ([#16144][_#16144])  # Resolves #16109 After reading through the uwebsockets code, I understand now that the maxBackpressure websocket option was *only* being used to decide when to drop packets.  We never want to drop packets, so setting that to zero is the correct behavior. Backpressure is still a legitimate concern.  If we keep shoving data into the send buffer faster than the websocket can send, then backpressure will build up (consuming memory and causing the visualizer to fall behind the main thread).  I've provided a `Flush()` command for Meshcat which allows users to manually sync the main thread if it is useful/needed in their application.
* TBD [hydro] Make MeshFieldLinear compatible with PolygonSurfaceMesh ([#16122][_#16122])  # - The mesh field has conditional barycentric behavior (as barycentric coordinates are not well defined for polygonal elements). - Provides an alias and instantiation for MeshFieldLinear on PolygonSurfaceMesh (to parallel TriangleSurfaceMeshFieldLinear).
* TBD [tools,multibody,examples,geometry,lcmtypes] [hydroelastic] Modify contact surface visualization LCM ([#16102][_#16102])  # This changes the representation of a mesh in the contact surface lcm message. This change makes it forward compatible with when we want to render polygonal meshes. It leads to the removal of a custom triangle message for contact surfaces. The various call sites that are responsible for generating such a message have been updated to write to the new format. Incidentally, various variable names (e.g., msg) that were *not* styleguide compliant have been updated to remove the bad abbreviation. The drake_visualizer plugin has been likewise modified to handle the new representation. In addition, how it handles drawing edges on the contact surface has been streamlined (it uses VTK functionality for drawing hidden line objects instead of creating multiple meshes).
* TBD Polish hydro surface visualization ([#16115][_#16115])  # 1. Modify control for displaying surface edges - width can now be controlled. 2. The intensity map creates its complementary color more generically. - Changed the default colors of the intensity map to provide better color contrast. 3. Some function documentation cleaned up. 4. Python-ized Qt slot-signal connection.
