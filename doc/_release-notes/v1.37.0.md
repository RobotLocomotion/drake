title: Drake v1.37.0
date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* Drake now offically supports macOS 15 Sequoia ([#22324][_#22324])
* On macOS, Ipopt is now compiled from source instead of using Homebrew ([#22331][_#22331])
  * One consequence is that MUMPS is no longer available as one of IPOPT's
    linear solvers. The only available linear solver is SPRAL.
* YAML load/save can now handle bytes and paths ([#22288][_#22288], [#22318][_#22318]).
* SAP is now the default contact solver for discrete MultibodyPlant. This may cause different simulation results for users who rely on the default contact solver/approximation. ([#21294][_#21294])

# Breaking changes since v1.36.0

* `InitialValueProgram` changed the data type of some static constants ([#22358][_#22358])
* Remove LinearModelPredictiveControl ([#22306][_#22306])
* If downstream C++ code calls RenderEngine::Clone and the runtime type of the RenderEngine is a downstream Python subclass, then the call will now throw an exception. The C++ call must be updated to opt-in to the shared_ptr template argument. ([#22353][_#22353])
* `InverseDynamicsController::get_output_port_control()` now reports the actuation on joint actuators instead of generalized forces on all joints. The generalized forces on all joints are still reported, but through `get_output_port_generalized_force()` ([#22315][_#22315])

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* Offically support macOS 15 Sequoia ([#22324][_#22324])
* The command line option `--define=DRAKE_WERROR=ON` no longer has any effect ([#22335][_#22335])
* Use modern spelling for Bazel config options ([#22393][_#22393])

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [workspace,tools,cmake,doc] [build] Use MODULE.bazel for all dependencies ([#22338][_#22338])  # The WORKSPACE.bzlmod is no longer load-bearing, so as of this commit it should be possible to consume Drake as a module external of other downstream projects (instead of as a repository external). Notable changes: Document our stability promises for our module extension. Adjust CMake logic to use its own MODULE.bazel.in that consumes Drake as a module external, and to override choices for other dependencies using conventional Bazel command-line flags instead of editing the WORKSPACE file. Adjust the pkg_config repository rule to handle the new distinction between canonical vs apparent repository names. Ditto for the java maven repositories (only relevant on macOS). Adjust our lcm native code loader to accommodate the new runfiles layout. Add test coverage for EventLog (which uses a distinctive spelling of its import paths in upstream code). Adjust labels used by our (non-symbolic) pybind11 macro to only ever refer to the drake label, not the external label. Textual macros resolve labels in the workspace context of the code calling them, not Drake. Therefore they must only ever refer to Drake, since Drake's externals are now invisible (by default) with bzlmod. We introduce Drake aliases for the externals so that we can use a safe labels in our macros. (This fix is only necessary for macros which we expect downstream code to call, i.e., macros without a "drake_..." prefix in their name. We still have plenty of other drake-specific macros that refer to non-drake labels, but that's not a problem.) The longer term fix for this will probably be switching from textual macros to symbolic macros, but we don't attempt that here. Adjust some of our hard-coded runfiles paths (header_lint test, wheel build snopt, drake_models parse_test) to align with the new canonical repository names.
* Require Bazel >= 7.4 ([#22305][_#22305])
* Add `rules_java` external ([#22305][_#22305])
