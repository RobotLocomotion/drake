title: Drake v1.37.0
date: 2025-01-15
released: 2025-01-15
---

# Announcements

* The default `DiscreteContactApproximation` for MultibodyPlant has been updated to `kLagged`.
  * This approximation integrates engineering-quality, physics-based models
    into our convex formulations, providing strong convergence guarantees. The
    resulting SAP formulation is both robust and high-performing, while
    preserving physical accuracy. Refer to [Castro et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03908)
    for further details. Keep in mind that this may cause different simulation
    results, and users who rely on a specific contact approximation might need
    to update their code and/or modeling assumptions ([#21294][_#21294]).
* Drake now officially supports macOS 15 Sequoia ([#22324][_#22324]).
* On macOS, Ipopt is now compiled from source instead of using Homebrew ([#22331][_#22331]).
  * One consequence is that MUMPS is no longer available as one of Ipopt's
    linear solvers. The only available linear solver is SPRAL.
* For Bazel users, Drake has been ported to
  [Bazel modules](https://bazel.build/external/module) instead of repository
  rules ([#22338][_#22338], [#22432][_#22432]).
  * Please start porting your project to the new technology. See the
    [drake_bazel_external](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-external-examples/tree/main/drake_bazel_external)
    example for how to use this from your project.
  * Refer to the comments in
    [drake/tools/flags/BUILD.bazel](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/tools/flags/BUILD.bazel)
    to see new flags you can use to govern the dependencies.
  * After Drake has good support for modules, we plan to deprecate Drake's
    repository rules for removal. For updates, follow [#20731][_#20731].
* When building from source with CMake, the default value for `WITH_USER_EIGEN`
  and `WITH_USER_FMT` and `WITH_USER_SPDLOG` is now `ON`. In other words, CMake
  will use `find_package` to locate dependencies, instead of `pkg-config`
  ([#22421][_#22421]).
* YAML load/save can now handle bytes and paths ([#22288][_#22288], [#22318][_#22318]).
* Drake now uses AVX512 instructions (when available) for hand-coded Highway (SIMD) functions. ([#22423][_#22423]).
  To opt-out for reproducible results, see
    <a href="/doxygen_cxx/group__environment__variables.html">DRAKE_DISABLE_CPU_FEATURES</a>.

# Breaking changes since v1.36.0

* `InitialValueProgram` changed the data type of some static constants ([#22358][_#22358])
* Remove LinearModelPredictiveControl ([#22306][_#22306])
* If downstream C++ code calls RenderEngine::Clone and the runtime type of the RenderEngine is a downstream Python subclass, then the call will now throw an exception. The C++ call must be updated to opt-in to the shared_ptr template argument. ([#22353][_#22353])
* `InverseDynamicsController::get_output_port_control()` now reports the actuation on joint actuators instead of generalized forces on all joints. The generalized forces on all joints are still reported, but through `get_output_port_generalized_force()` ([#22315][_#22315])

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.37.0) named
``drake-1.37.0-{jammy|noble|mac-arm64}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
