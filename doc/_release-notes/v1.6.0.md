title: Drake v1.6.0
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* This release marks the first appearance of the new planning folder.
  * The first set of planning software will come from TRI's private Anzu code
     base. Look for this to arrive in chunks over the next several releases.
     
# Breaking changes since v1.5.0

* TBD
* `drake::math::ExtractGradient` now accounts for the storage order of its
  input, instead of always tracing in ColMajor order. For most users this will
  be no change because Eigen's default storage is ColMajor
  anyway. ([#17516][_#17516])

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Changes since v1.5.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* TBD

Fixes

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD Add python binding of SubstituteStereographicProjection ([#17617][_#17617])
* TBD [visualization] Improve meldis error message ([#17642][_#17642])  # Meldis does not yet support hydroelastic meshes that are transmitted inline.
* TBD [pydrake] Binding ContactSurface mesh fields ([#17637][_#17637])  # 1. Binding the underlying mesh field types: - PolygonSurfaceMeshField - TriangleSurfaceMeshField 2. Bind the missing methods on ContactSurface. 3. Unit tests on newly bound code. - Generally, unit tests on ContactSurface bindings were missing, and this adds them.
* TBD [pydrake/lcm] Overload constructors to take an LcmInterfaceSystem ([#17668][_#17668])  # For the LcmPublisherSystem and LcmSubscriberSystem constructors.
* TBD Add python binding on GurobiSolver callbacks ([#17704][_#17704])
* TBD Rational function python bindings ([#17522][_#17522])  # In addition to binding the previously unbound RationalFunction, we also extend its functionality and tests: 1. It can be constructed on Monomial. 2. We define mathematical operations w.r.t. Monomial. 3. Provide the missing ToExpression and SetIndetermiantes APIs.
* TBD Add python binding for ComputeNumericalGradient ([#17684][_#17684])

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

Newly bound

* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* TBD [workspace] Upgrade mypy to latest commit ([#17552][_#17552])  # Update mypy, bringing in a patch to increase the timeout before aborting an attempt to import a module. The default timeout of 5s is not long enough to import `pydrake` in some configurations. Also increase the timeout on our `stubgen_test`. See https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/13109.
* TBD [doc,tools] [doc] Document all nightly uploads and expiration policies ([#17413][_#17413])  # - Advertise nightly `.tar.gz`, `.deb`, and python wheel urls. - Download links with YYYYMMDD in their url are available for ~56 days after their upload.  Previously these were available for 2 years. - Build artifacts for drake hosted in the drake-packages s3 bucket are available for 5 years from upload (e.g., ubuntu VTK tarballs).
* TBD [doc] Add macOS stable releases for pip wheels ([#17619][_#17619])  # I've uploaded a v1.5.0 wheel using this process.
* TBD [workspace] Update MUMPS to 5.5.0 ([#17626][_#17626])  # Update the version of MUMPS used to build wheels to 5.5.0, matching recent updates to homebrew.
* TBD [pydrake] Ignore Eigen::Sparse overloads when scipy is missing ([#17570][_#17570])  # [workspace] Upgrade pybind11 to latest commit.
* TBD Use Ubuntu mirror for MUMPS (wheel builds) ([#17646][_#17646])  # MUMPS has recently become unreliable as far as providing tarballs. In order to be less dependent on upstream, switch to using Ubuntu's source mirror as the preferred source for the tarball. Note that, because Ubuntu only ships a limited set of versions, this requires downgrading to 5.4.1, which as far as I can tell has never been shipped by Homebrew. Thus, in this respect, the macOS wheels will be more similar to the Ubuntu wheels than the macOS non-wheels.
* TBD [setup,tools] [workspace] Remove scipy dependency ([#17559][_#17559])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade gz_math_internal to latest version ([#17673][_#17673])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade abseil_cpp_internal to latest commit ([#17669][_#17669])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade dm_control_internal to latest commit ([#17669][_#17669])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade googlebenchmark to latest release v1.7.0 ([#17669][_#17669])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade pycodestyle to latest release 2.9.0 ([#17669][_#17669])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade rules_python to latest release 0.10.2 ([#17669][_#17669])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade styleguide to latest commit ([#17669][_#17669])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade common_robotics_utilities to latest commit ([#17669][_#17669])
* TBD [workspace] Upgrade voxelized_geometry_tools to latest commit ([#17669][_#17669])
* TBD Bump CRU & VGT to latest ([#17702][_#17702])
* TBD

## Build dependencies

<!-- Manually relocate any "Upgrade foo_external to latest" lines to here, -->
<!-- and then sort them alphabetically. -->

* TBD

## Newly-deprecated APIs

* TBD
* `drake::systems::ApplySimulatorConfig` with simulator argument first ([#17654][_#17654])
* `//multibody/inverse_kinematics:kinematic_constraint` ([#17575][_#17575])([#17585][_#17585])
* `drake::multibody::Body` when name is empty ([#17632][_#17632])
* `drake::multibody::FixedOffsetFrame` when name is empty, or overload with no name parameter ([#17632][_#17632])

* `drake::multibody::RigidBody` overload with no name parameter ([#17632][_#17632])


## Removal of deprecated items

* TBD
