# Changes since v1.9.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* [breaking change] TBD Switch EventData from heap to std::variant ([#18068][_#18068])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [solvers] Gurobi solver options are handled more gracefully ([#18124][_#18124])
* [fix] TBD [solvers] Fix MathematicalProgram::Clone to clone everything ([#18135][_#18135])  # Previously, at least the visualization callbacks were not cloned.
* [feature] TBD Add affine cone constraint in Mosek ([#18114][_#18114])
* [feature] TBD [solvers] Support L2NormCost in SnoptSolver and IpoptSolver ([#18184][_#18184])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [geometry/optimization] Fix multiple Vertex costs bug ([#18043][_#18043])
* [feature] TBD [meshcat] Support keycodes in JointSliders ([#18087][_#18087])
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD [multibody,geometry] [parsing] Add Parser::AddModelsFromString ([#18110][_#18110])  # This new method allows DMD format data to be read from a string. The patch also deprecates the problematic "singular" string method.
* [fix feature] TBD ScrewJoint: accept axis unit vector in constructor ([#18019][_#18019])  # Adds a constructor to ScrewJoint that accepts a Vector3<double> for the axis unit vector and a screw_axis() accessor method to the class. The current constructor that assumes the axis unit vector is the Z-axis is retained but may be considered for deprecation in the future. The constructor implementation is moved to the .cc file and throws a std::logic_error if invalid parameters are supplied. Adds a Vector3<double> argument to ScrewMobilizer that is required to have a non-zero norm. The mobilizer math is updated to use this axis instead of assuming the Z-axis. screw_mobilizer_test: a bug in the CalcAcrossMobilizerSpatialVeloctiy method and test is fixed to use angular velocity as generalized velocity It now matches the way spatial acceleration is implemented and tested. An additional expectation on the product of force and velocity computed in different frames is added.
* [newly deprecated] TBD Deprecate Python default parameters for ScrewJoint ([#18122][_#18122])  # * Makes python default parameters of ScrewJoint compatible with the ones in the C++ API. Co-Authored-By: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD [multibody,workspace] [workspace] Upgrade sdformat_internal to 13.1.0 ([#18130][_#18130])  # There are some new overloads of the Load() methods that take a ParserConfig object so that the old APIs use GlobalConfig, so pass the StrictConfig to those APIs.
* [fix] TBD [multibody] Adds hydro forces to continuous mode reaction forces computation ([#18057][_#18057])
* [feature] TBD [meshcat] Add a binding/doc/test for SetTriangleColorMesh ([#18100][_#18100])  # Resolves #18096.
* [fix] TBD Add multibody::world_frame_index() getter ([#18149][_#18149])  # multibody_plant_test: Test properties of elements in empty plant Replace usages of `FrameIndex(0)` with `world_frame_index()` multibody_tree_index: - Replace MultibodyTree with MultibodyPlant - Test all public functions py plant_test: Replace `BodyIndex(0)` with `world_index()`

* [feature] TBD [multibody,common] Add RationalForwardKinematics ([#17572][_#17572])
* [feature] TBD [multibody,systems] Add ExternallyAppliedSpatialForceMultiplexer ([#18171][_#18171])  # py plant: - Remove unneeded qualifier for ExternallyAppliedSpatialForce - test_propeller: Use body name rather than magic number adder_test: - Add check for discrete number of states - Use std::make_unique instead of .reset()
* [feature] TBD [geometry/optimization] Allow IrisInConfigurationSpace to optionally consider configuration space obstacles ([#18136][_#18136])
* [fix] TBD [meshcat] Fix PerspectiveCamera msgpack ([#18213][_#18213])
* [feature] TBD [meshcat] JointSliders::Run() returns the final positions ([#18215][_#18215])  # As requested in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74251312/pydrake-how-to-return-joint-positions-in-forward-kinematics-example/74254419
* [feature] TBD [multibody,planning] [parsing] Modernize parser.AddAllModelsFromFile ([#18208][_#18208])

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Install .pyi files ([#18074][_#18074])  # This reverts commit 9a0f31a706ffa4b8d77846d7629f0616b55ecc97, effectively re-applying commit a61a1846ff3b0e49e66f3f92beac29121adb32dc. Add rules to generate (as part of the build) and install type stubs for pydrake. Modify wheel build to include these as well. Note that this makes numpy and matplotlib build-time dependencies. (Previously they were only required to test/run pydrake.) Note also that there are issues remaining with the .pyi's; in particular, they are completely unusable by mypy. Co-authored-by: Matthew Woehlke <matthew.woehlke@kitware.com>
* [fix] TBD Fix installation of symlinks ([#18107][_#18107])  # Tweak logic to install symlinks to forcibly replace existing entities. This behavior is more consistent with installing files, which already replaces existing entities. Also, add the start of a unit test suite for the installer, testing this function specifically. Fixes #18007.
* [fix] TBD [tools,doc] Improve error reporting when pydrake import fails ([#18015][_#18015])  # Modify pydrake (at least, `import pydrake.all`) to detect when it can't be loaded due to failure to load a dynamic library, and to give a somewhat more user-friendly error message. Add a brief document listing what distro packages need to be installed, which is output by the aforementioned error. Add a note to update the web instructions to refer to the new documentation. Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [newly deprecated] TBD [pydrake] Rename visualization files to preserve history ([#18160][_#18160])  # N.B. This commit does not build.
* [feature] TBD Provide Python module information in drake-config.cmake ([#18201][_#18201])  # This will provide a reliable way for downstream CMake projects to get information about the Python modules installed as part of Drake.
* [feature] TBD [wheel] Enable mac arm64 wheel builds ([#18189][_#18189])  # - Update libjpeg-turbo version, use CMake to build not autotools. - Update libpng version to include macOS arm64 specific fixes.
* TBD

## Build dependencies

URIs in lcmt_viewer_load_robot, but no code within Drake does that anyway. Users who need to load Drake package URIs via that message can set either of two environment variables to enable package map searching: export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/drake export DRAKE_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/drake
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Don't abort for unsupported macOS versions ([#18210][_#18210])

* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade tinyobjloader to latest commit ([#18244][_#18244])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade typing_extensions_internal to latest release 4.4.0 ([#18244][_#18244])
* [fix] TBD [workspace,tools,math] [workspace] Add dependency on bazelbuild/platforms ([#18250][_#18250])  # Bazel 6.0 will remove the built-in copy, requiring users to BYO.
* TBD

## Newly-deprecated APIs

* pydrake.visualization.meldis.Meldis ([#18160][_#18160])
<!-- should this spell out the functions in the deprecated module or just the module? -->
* pydrake.visualization.plotting ([#18160][_#18160])

## Removal of deprecated items

* TBD
