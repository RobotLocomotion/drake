# Changes since v1.7.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* TBD [systems,doc] Updating context-system mismatch error messages ([#17711][_#17711])  # When validating contexts against systems, we've added a bit more analysis for recognizing whether the system or the context are the root and provide custom messages reflecting that. Furthermore, all error messages for Context validation include a URL in the troubleshooting webpage to provide elaboration. To that end: - Change logic in ValidateContext() for special cases. - Write the troubleshooting entry. - Tests - For dependency reasons, the testing is distributed over two test files. system_base_test.cc avoids dependencies on diagram-level constructs. So, diagram_test.cc gets those tests.
* TBD [systems,geometry] [geometry] Camera specification does more rigorous validation ([#17750][_#17750])  # 1. CameraInfo - Documented to throw even though it didn't. - Throwing conditions have been extended and implementation supports it. - Test extended to support documentation. 2. ClippingRange and DepthRange - Previously tested for positive, now also test for finite.
* TBD [sensors] Add CameraConfig ([#17787][_#17787])  # CameraConfig provides a single struct for configuring a simulated camera. It includes: - Camera intrinsics - Camera extrinsics for independent color and depth sensors - Rendering configuration (vis a vis SceneGraph's RenderEngines) - Image publishing configuration.
* TBD [sensors] Add ApplyCameraConfig function ([#17827][_#17827])  # This is more or less a verbatim copy of the cleaned up Anzu code. There is one exception. ApplyCameraConfig() originally created an OpenGL-based render engine. In anzu, that was fine (the OpenGL render engine is always available for anzu applications). For Drake, generally, that is not the case. This swaps VTK for GL and defers the question of configuring the *type* of render engine for the future.

New features

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->


New features

* None

Fixes

* TBD GetInfeasibleConstraints: Only return infeasible constraint once ([#17818][_#17818])
* TBD [symbolic] Add ExpressionCell::EvaluatePartial for performance ([#17727][_#17727])
* TBD NewSosPolynomial detects uninitialized enum values ([#17754][_#17754])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD [geometry,visualization,examples] [geometry] Add Rgba::Serialize support ([#17762][_#17762])  # Rgba serializes as an array-like value. The contents must have either three or four values and must all lie in the range [0, 1]. Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* TBD [geometry/optimization] Change GCS SolveShortestPath to take configuration options ([#17396][_#17396])
* TBD Implements HPolyhedron::Serialize() ([#17783][_#17783])  # I would imagine eventually supporting serialization for all of the convex set classes, but HPolyhedron is a particularly important special case since it is how we represent IRIS regions (which we precompute offline).
* TBD [multibody/parsing] Add support for default positions in model directives ([#17802][_#17802])  # Adds the ability to set default joint positions and default free body poses in the add_model directive. I would have liked to be able to enable a tag like default_positions which takes a vector, but the position vector is not defined until after Finalize(), so it unavailable at parsing time. Related to #13065, and this slack discussion: https://drakedevelopers.slack.com/archives/C2WBPQDB7/p1601749507024400
* TBD [multibody] MultibodyPlant::SetDefaultPositions ([#17793][_#17793])  # Add sugar methods for setting the default position vector for all joints / floating-bodies in a plant or model instance.
* TBD [multibody/parsing] Add optional X_PC to model directives AddWeld ([#17811][_#17811])
* TBD Create new function MultibodyPlant::CalcSpatialInertia() ([#17770][_#17770])
* TBD [multibody/parsing] LoadModelDirectivesFromString ([#17810][_#17810])
* TBD [meshcat] no crash from visualizing almost-zero hydroelastic force or moment ([#17757][_#17757])
* TBD [geometry/optimization] Enable preprocessing GCS before solving ShortestPath ([#17397][_#17397])
* TBD Add RigidTransform multiply by Vector4d ([#17790][_#17790])
