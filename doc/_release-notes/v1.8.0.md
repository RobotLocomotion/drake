* GetInfeasibleConstraints only returns infeasible constraint once ([#17818][_#17818])
* NewSosPolynomial detects uninitialized enum values ([#17754][_#17754])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD [multibody] Compute bodies affected by joints ([#17800][_#17800])  # * [multibody] Compute bodies kinematically affected by joints
New features

* Add MultibodyPlant::SetDefaultPositions ([#17793][_#17793])
* Add MultibodyPlant::CalcSpatialInertia ([#17770][_#17770])
* Add Rgba::Serialize support ([#17762][_#17762])

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* TBD [manipulation/models] Fix colors on kinova jaco models ([#17838][_#17838])  # These were fixed upstream in https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros/pull/222. But that PR only fixed the 6DOF model, and made the fix by completely replacing the mesh files.  Here I've just taken the (diffuse) color from the mesh file and applied it in the URDF.
* TBD [manipulation,systems] [planning] Add initialization event to DiffIK Integrator ([#17824][_#17824])  # The integrator in Diff IK needs to be set to the initial state of the robot in order to avoid a large delta at time zero. Previously, users had to call SetPositions() manually; and this has to happen after Diagram is built (when a context is created, etc). Because this occurs in a different part of the code from where the Diff IK system is created and the parameters configured, I often saw people copying part of the code and forgetting the initialization, leading to strange errors. This PR offers a cleaner workflow where an additional port is connected at the time that DiffIK is constructed and added to the builder; then an Initialization event takes care of setting the initial integrator state.
* TBD [perception] Add PointCloud::Crop and Concatenate(vector<PointCloud>) ([#17829][_#17829])  # Towards https://github.com/RussTedrake/manipulation/issues/130.
* Expose measurement time as an output from received iiwa status ([#17761][_#17761])

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.8.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
