title: Drake v1.12.0
date: YYYY-MM-DD
released: YYYY-MM-DD

# Announcements

# Breaking changes since v1.11.0

* `InputPort::Allocate` (introduced in v1.11.0) has been relocated to
  `InputPortBase::Allocate` ([#18525][_#18525])
* `MultibodyElement` no longer takes the `Body` and `BodyNodeIndex` template
  parameters.  We expect that nobody was using that class in practice, but
  if you were, simply delete the first and last template parameters.
  ([#18460][_#18460]) ([#18526][_#18526])

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
