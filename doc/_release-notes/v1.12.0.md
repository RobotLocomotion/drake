## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [doc,tools,workspace] Add Linux Python 3.11 wheel ([#18468][_#18468])
* [] TBD [doc] add carrot scooping video to the drake gallery ([#18489][_#18489])
* [fix] TBD [tools,workspace] [workspace] Upgrade rules_python to latest release 0.16.1 ([#18524][_#18524])  # Co-Authored-By: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* [fix] TBD Allow unsupported compilers with warning (CMake) ([#18498][_#18498])
* [fix] TBD [setup] Avoid accidentally installing OpenBLAS ([#18540][_#18540])  # Drake by default should stick with the Ubuntu default BLAS (Netlib). Users are invited to install a custom BLAS, but we shouldn't force it. Through a chain of calamities in upstream Ubuntu 22.04 packaging, Drake's binary_distribution dependency on python3-matplotlib leads to the dependency chain of: python3-matplotlib => python3-fonttools => python3-scipy | python3-munkres with python3-scipy => python3-pythran => libopenblas-dev | ... | libblas.so This ends up installing the OpenBLAS dev package, trumping our source_distribution dependency preference for libblas-dev that comes along in the second install command. Work around this problem by elevating Drake's BLAS dev package dependency from a source dep to a binary dep, which is able to guide python3-pythran's disjunction to use Netlib. Furthermore, now that we see SciPy in the chain (and knowing that Drake goes to great lengths to not require SciPy), add a binary dependency on python3-munkres to short-circuit that disjunction in order to reduce our footprint. Technically munkres on its own (without the libblas-dev change) would be sufficient to get us to Netlib BLAS, but we'll keep the dev package in binary deps to preempt similar potholes in the future.

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.12.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{focal|jammy|mac|mac-arm64}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
