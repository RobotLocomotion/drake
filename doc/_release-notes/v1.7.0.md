## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* TBD Install .pyi files ([#17709][_#17709])  # Add rules to generate (as part of the build) and install type stubs for pydrake. Modify wheel build to include these as well. Note that this makes numpy and matplotlib build-time dependencies. (Previously they were only required to test/run pydrake.) Note also that there are issues remaining with the .pyi's; in particular, they are completely unusable by mypy. Co-authored-by: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global>
* TBD [workspace] Support fmt v9 on macOS ([#17739][_#17739])  # See also `FMT_DEPRECATED_OSTREAM` in the release notes: https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/releases/tag/9.0.0
* TBD [workspace] Support fmt v9 on macOS wheel ([#17743][_#17743])  # Followup to #17739.
* TBD

## Build dependencies

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v1.7.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
