# Changes since v1.33.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* Add parameters to RgbdSensor ([#21937][_#21937])

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Handle unbounded domains in Iris and IrisInConfigurationSpace if the user specifies a valid bounding region ([#21942][_#21942])  # We no longer throw an error in Iris when the initial domain is unbounded, but the user has specified a bounding region such that their intersection is bounded.
* [feature] TBD Implement AffineBall::DoAddPointInNonnegativeScalingConstraints ([#21898][_#21898])
* [feature] TBD Marks the thread safety of EvaluatorBase and MathematicalProgram ([#21903][_#21903])  # Adds a field to EvaluatorBase declaring whether it is safe to call the `Eval` function concurrently. Adds a method to MathematicalProgram declaring whether is is safe to call `Solve` concurrently.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Derivative Boundary conditions in Toppra::SolvePathParameterization ([#21975][_#21975])
* [feature] TBD [geometry,common] Introduce InMemoryMesh and MeshSource ([#21890][_#21890])  # These provide the foundation of in-memory mesh specification. InMemoryMesh tracks a MemoryFile for a mesh file (and an optional set of supporting files in the near future). MeshSource acts as a sugared-up variant between a filesystem::path and an InMemoryMesh. This will, ultimately, serve as the storage for Mesh and Convex specifications. While it is not integrated with Mesh or Convex yet, we exercise the new APIs in vtk_to_volume_mesh -- which consumes the MeshSource and creates the VolumeMesh from both in-memory as well as on-disk .vtk files.
* [fix] TBD Fix contact force port crash when deformables are present ([#21931][_#21931])
* [feature] TBD [geometry,workspace,multibody] Implement obj->mesh in terms of MeshSource ([#21914][_#21914])  # The obj-to-mesh utilities in read_obj.* and obj_to_surface_mesh.* have been updated to take a MeshSource as an argument (relying on its implicit conversion ability to maintain compatibility with call sites). This had the following downstream effects: - detail_mesh_parser.cc was calling directly into DoReadObjToSurfaceMesh(). Its invocation has changed to follow the new API. - Various error messages have evolved; tests attempting to capture the error messsages have followed suit. To facilitate this effort, we patch tinyobjloader to facilitate parsing from an in-memory file more efficiently. - The current API builds a stream from the data without copying. - A new API allows specifying a material reader instead of the mtl text.
* [feature] TBD [geometry,common,multibody] Add supporting files to InMemoryMesh ([#21923][_#21923])  # This revisits the InMemoryMesh making it a simple struct, simplifying bindings and call sites (and updating previously merged code). Supporting files are implemented via a "FileSource" - an alias for a variant between a filesystem::path and a drake::MemoryFile. This allows an in-memory mesh's supporting files to reference resources on disk as well as other in-memory files.
* [feature] TBD Mesh and Convex now uses MeshSource as storage ([#21922][_#21922])  # MeshSource replaces the "filename" and "extension" members. For now, the InMemoryMesh-valued constructors are marked internal in documentation and filename() semantics is changed to throw if someone attempts to call filename on an in-memory mesh. This throwing behavior is equivalent to placing a `DRAKE_DEMAND(mesh.source().is_path())` *everywhere* a mesh.filename() is currently used. As support for MeshSource spreads, errors will evaporate. We exercise the new storage in a limited case: creating a rigid hydro mesh from a MeshSource. Furthermore, we update MakeVolumeMeshFromVtk: - That function should not be used on Convex -- we should be computing a VolumeMesh from its convex hull. - Rather than taking a path, it takes a Mesh and passes the mesh's source to ReadVtkToVolumeMesh().
* [feature] TBD RenderMesh and RenderMaterial parse .obj files from MeshSource ([#21944][_#21944])  # This builds on the addition of MeshSource having supporting files (as material definitions require .mtl and possibly texture images). The RenderMesh infrastructure includes a custom tinyobj::MaterialReader in order to host .mtl file data from disk or memory. This introduces a new internal class: TextureSource. This is akin to a FileSource, but where FileSource has two modes, TextureSource has four to span a greater number of definitions for glTFs embedded textures.
* [feature] TBD [multibody,geometry] [parsing] Add parsing for hydro margin to SDFormat, URDF ([#21831][_#21831])  # Also fix a few stray problems noticed on the way.
* [feature] TBD Add utility for working with glTF files ([#21949][_#21949])  # This converts a path to a glTF file into a fully-specified InMemoryMesh of same by chasing down the buffer and image references to external files and packing them into the in-memory mesh's supporting files.
* [feature] TBD Convex hull computation uses MeshSource ([#21945][_#21945])  # Implementation of making the convex hull mesh updates based on mesh file extension: - .obj: Make use of ReadObj based on MeshSource. - .vtk: Make use of ReadVtkToVolumeMesh based on MeshSource. - .gltf: deferred to next PR. The soft hydro Convex shape makes use of this to inflate the convex shape.
