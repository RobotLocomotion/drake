<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [newly deprecated fix] TBD [multibody,tutorials,examples,planning] Tighten meaning of "floating base body": it is on an emphemeral 6dof joint ([#23412][_#23412])  # Also fixes a bug in a detail_dmd_parser_test.cc case. Renamed functions Free -> FloatingBase for clarity.
* [feature] TBD Add SSAO support to the VTK renderer ([#23174][_#23174])

* [feature] TBD Optionally relax the configuration space margin for IrisNp2 and IrisZo instead of throwing an error ([#23389][_#23389])
* [fix] TBD Fix IrisZo bug where the number of samples was incorrectly capped ([#23441][_#23441])

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [lcm,tools,lcmtypes,workspace,doc] [workspace] Add two flags for opting-out of LCM features ([#23435][_#23435])  # * When WITH_LCM_RUNTIME is OFF, libdrake_lcm.so will not be installed and the static methods DrakeLcm{,Log}::available() will return false. * When DRAKE_INSTALL_JAVA is OFF, lcmtypes_drake.jar will not be installed.
* [newly deprecated] TBD [lcmtypes,examples,systems,lcm,manipulation,geometry,multibody,common,perception] [lcmtypes] Deprecate fine-grained C++ libraries ([#23467][_#23467])  # Deprecate the narrow //lcmtypes:foo cc_library targets and instead use a single target with all messages for simplicity. The messages don't change enough to merit the work of fine-grained dependency tracking. This will also make it easier to port to LCM upstream's new starlark rules in a future commit.
* [fix] TBD [lcmtypes,tools,workspace] [workspace] Add lcm_internal ([#23462][_#23462])  # Newer LCM upstream offers native support for Bazel. Add a second repository rule for it (named `"@lcm_internal"`) as a step towards deprecating the existing repository rule (`"@lcm"`). Switch to use its code for lcm-bazel message generation macros and the lcm-gen binary. This requires updating our C++ lcm_gen program to use the same command line arguments as upstream. Our LCM runtime library (and Java tools) still come from `"@lcm"`, for now.
* [fix] TBD Fix InertiaVisualizer for point masses ([#23464][_#23464])  # Previously, point masses would produce nan-valued ellipsoids (the code implicitly required at least one moment of inertia to be non-zero). Now we account for point masses directly. All other mass distributions (line, plate, volume) are already accounted for.
* TBD

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [newly deprecated] TBD [tools] Mark drake::drake-marker for deprecation ([#23459][_#23459])
* [feature] TBD [tools,doc,lcmtypes,workspace] [workspace] Provide Python installation opt-out ([#23460][_#23460])  # Add CMake and Bazel options to opt out of installing pydrake, pybind11 headers, tutorials, and Python lcmtypes. While the build still requires a working Python interpreter, this slims down the install for C++ users.
* [breaking change] TBD [doc,tools,.github] [doc] Drop support for macOS Sonoma ([#23461][_#23461])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency bazel to v8.4.1 ([#23476][_#23476])
* [fix] TBD [third_party,tools,common,doc] [build] Optionally install a static `libdrake.a` ([#23298][_#23298])  # Build static and shared copies of `libdrake`, and provide CMake and Bazel options to decide which one to install. Installing `libdrake` statically is incompatible with installing Python tools and LCM runtime support. Vendor Bazel's `cc_static_library` to build the library, as it was only de-experimentalized as of Bazel 8.4.0. For now, `libdrake.a` still can't be distributed as a single binary, because Drake's `find_resource` relies on dynamic loading of the marker library.
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_cc to v0.2.8 ([#23486][_#23486])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency fmt to v12 ([#23485][_#23485])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_shell to v0.6.1 ([#23488][_#23488])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_java to v8.16.1 ([#23489][_#23489])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency bazel_features to v1.36.0 ([#23490][_#23490])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency bazel_skylib to v1.8.2 ([#23491][_#23491])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency toolchains_llvm to v1.5.0 ([#23492][_#23492])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_python to v1.6.3 ([#23493][_#23493])
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade python venv (mac) to latest ([#23500][_#23500])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency rules_rust to v0.65.0 ([#23506][_#23506])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency nasm to v2.16.03.bcr.2 ([#23507][_#23507])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency zlib to v1.3.1.bcr.7 ([#23508][_#23508])
* [fix] TBD Update dependency bazel to v8.4.2 ([#23514][_#23514])
* [fix] TBD [doc] Update supported Xcode to 26.0 ([#23494][_#23494])
* [fix] TBD [tools,setup] [setup] Use patchelf from bzlmod instead of ubuntu ([#23522][_#23522])  # This helps Drake be more portable when installing from source, and more hermetic when testing (one less undeclared dependency). Note that the wheel build still uses the almalinux patchelf, but that's fine because it runs inside docker.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade llvm to 20.1.7 ([#23516][_#23516])  # This only affects our clang-format version.
* [newly deprecated fix] TBD [tools,common,setup] [setup] Remove diff and file as source prereqs ([#23523][_#23523])  # This helps Drake be more portable when installing from source, and more hermetic when testing (one less undeclared dependency). Deprecate the resource_tool program.
* TBD

* [fix] TBD [workspace,tools] [workspace] Upgrade crate_universe to latest ([#23504][_#23504])  # Adjust crate_universe vendoring to simplify MODULE.bazel.
