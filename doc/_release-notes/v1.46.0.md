title: Drake v1.46.0
date: 2025-10-17
released: 2025-10-17
---

# Announcements

* Drake no longer supports macOS Sonoma (i.e., macOS 14),
  as documented on our [OS Support](/stable.html#os-support) page and the
  [Supported Configurations](/installation.html#supported-configurations)
  table ([#23461][_#23461]).
  * We are working to add official support for macOS Tahoe (26) soon.
* We've added support for Eigen 5.0.0. To build Drake with Eigen 5.0.0 requires a patch to Eigen that has been upstreamed to the 5.0.x branch but not yet tagged into a release. Drake users who use their own version of Eigen 5.0.0 will also need to cherry-pick this patch file, or else wait until Eigen 5.0.1 is released. ([#23572][_#23572])
* Meshcat now supports high-dynamic range environment maps. Previously, Meshcat only supported low-dynamic range images (png, jpg, etc.). So, if you wanted to render an image with an HDR environment (via RenderEngineVtk) *and* visualize it via Meshcat, you had to have two versions of the same image. Now you can use the same HDR image in both applications. ([#23616][_#23616])
