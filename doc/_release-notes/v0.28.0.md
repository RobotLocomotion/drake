Title: Drake v0.28.0
---

# Announcements

* We are pleased to announce a major update to the Drake website, with clearer
  and more modern design.  We welcome any and all feedback and suggestions for
  how we can keep making it even better in the future!

# Breaking changes since v0.27.0

* A major bug fix for Systems with high-rate timed events (such as LCM publishers) ([#14663][_#14663])
  * Such systems in the past may have skipped time steps ([#12620][_#12620]).
  * With this change they will no longer miss those time steps, which may appear to the user as a performance regression or small behaviour change.
* Disable Drake Visualizer on macOS ([#14605][_#14605])
  * Drake Visualizer is disabled for at least as long as it takes to transition    Drake and VTK 8.2 to Python 3.9 or some alternative solution is found, see    [#14650][_#14650] for updates.

# Changes since v0.27.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* None

Fixes

* Evaluating fixed input ports with cloned contexts no longer segfaults ([#14701][_#14701])
* Earlier and more explicit checks that a Context matches its System ([#14738][_#14738])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

New features

* None

Fixes

* None

## Multibody Dynamics

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

New features

* Add capsule mesh ([#14642][_#14642])
* Add capsule field ([#14664][_#14664])
* Allow RenderEngine implementations that require warm starting ([#14677][_#14677])

Fixes

* Give better error when mobilizers clash ([#14655][_#14655])
* All `systems::multibody::MultibodyPlant` APIs that previously took `const std::string&` now use `std::string_view` instead.  This does not require any changes to callers, as the types convert transparently. ([#14719][_#14719])

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* Add LCM period argument to `AllegroCommandReceiver`'s constructor ([#14732][_#14732])
* Do not use `yaml.CLoader` in acrobot example ([#14750][_#14750])

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* Fix C++20 compatibility ([#14648][_#14648])
* Improve `AbstractValue` error message suggestions ([#14709][_#14709])

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

New features

* None

Fixes

* Fix the jupyter `runAll` mechanism when using `process_ipywidget_events` ([#14742][_#14742])

Newly bound

* None

## Build system and dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* Add hints for Binder / Colab ([#14660][_#14660])
* Switch to Python 3.9 on macOS ([#14605][_#14605])
* Allow users to build object code using `-std=c++20` mode without angering libclang ([#14669][_#14669])
* Hardcode python version to 3.6 in setup_drake_colab ([#14693][_#14693])
* Add script for building drake-visualizer binaries for Ubuntu ([#14573][_#14573])
* Use correct suffix for Python C extensions ([#14730][_#14730])
* Add CLP to drake build ([#14729][_#14729])
* Switch website to use Jekyll ([#14708][_#14708])

## Updated versions of externals

* Update to latest tinyobjloader and patch tryParseDouble ([#14656][_#14656])
* Upgrade ros_xacro to latest release 1.13.10 ([#14712][_#14712])
* Upgrade intel_realsense_ros to latest release 2.2.22 ([#14713][_#14713])
* Upgrade recommended Bazel version to 4.0 ([#14717][_#14717])
* Upgrade ghc_filesystem to latest release 1.5.0 ([#14711][_#14711])
* Upgrade osqp to latest release (0.6.2) and qdldl to latest release (0.1.5) ([#14714][_#14714])
* Upgrade meshcat and meshcat_python to latest commit ([#14715][_#14715])
* Upgrade sdformat to 10.3.0 ([#14705][_#14705])
* Upgrade CRU and VGT externals to latest ([#14728][_#14728])
* Update pybind11 fork to latest commit ([#14225][_#14225])

## Newly-deprecated APIs

* None

## Removal of deprecated items

* None

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v0.27.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{bionic|focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Nightly Releases](/from_binary.html#nightly-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
