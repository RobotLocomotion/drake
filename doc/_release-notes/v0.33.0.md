title: Drake v0.33.0
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* The geometry module offers a new CollisionFilterManager API.
* The geometry/optimization module offers many new features.
* The mathematical program module offers many improvements for debugging.
* The systems module offers more convenient API sugar.
* Several modules contain performance improvements.

# Breaking changes since v0.32.0

* The ``drake/examples/pendulum/Pendulum.urdf`` now includes a weld joint ([#15426][_#15426]).
  * Users who were adding the weld by hand and should remove their weld.
* The ``drake::systems::lcm::SerializerInterface`` has a new pure-virtual method for ``Clone`` ([#15394][_#15394]).
  * Users who were extending it directly (rather than using the concrete ``Serializer`` class) should to implement the new method.
* The ``drake::geometry::GeometryState`` class no longer offers ``ExcludeCollisionsWithin`` and ``ExcludeCollisionBetween`` ([#15348][_#15348]).
  * This class (though not in an `internal` namespace yet) is documented to be for Drake's internal use only.

# Changes since v0.32.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* TBD [systems,geometry,examples,manipulation] Deprecating PoseBundle ([#15534][_#15534])  # This deprecates PoseBundle as well as closely affiliated classes: PoseVector, PoseAggregator, PoseBundleToDrawMessage. There are two systems that have PoseBundle-valued output ports and two diagrams that export those ports. The systems had explicit getters for the ports; those getters have been deprecated. The diagrams were mixed. One had a getter, one relied on get_output_port(name). To generally aid the case where a leaf output port is exported, the calc methods of the two systems have been given a "log once" warning. Bindings and unit tests have likewise been updated.
* TBD Fix a comment in BasicVector ([#15588][_#15588])
* TBD primitives: Add python bindings for VectorLogSink and friends ([#15581][_#15581])  # Relevant to: #10228 This is step 3 of 4 to deprecate and replace SignalLogger and SignalLog with a logging system that avoids threading hazards (SignalLogger) and slow memory management (SignalLog). The patch adds bindings for VectorLog, VectorLogSink, and the LogVectorOutput convenience function, with bindings tests. Also addressed is a loose end from prior patches: the duplication of the type name TriggerTypeSet in systems:: and systems::lcm::. The systems::lcm:: definition is deprecated (likely with no downstream impact), and aliased to the identical systems:: definition. The surviving definition is moved to event.h to prepare for a possible future refactoring of redundant code using TriggerTypeSet.
* TBD [systems,common] Makes ValidateCreatedForThisSystem() inline-able and moves it to SystemBase ([#15595][_#15595])
New features

* Add sugar for declaring vector ports by size ([#15538][_#15538])
* Add sugar for setting/getting Eigen::VectorX data from DiscreteValues ([#15539][_#15539])
* Support fixed input ports in RegionOfAttraction ([#15425][_#15425])
* LCM's SerializerInterface is now cloneable ([#15394][_#15394])
* Add VectorLogSink system ([#15523][_#15523]) its VectorLog storage ([#15484][_#15484])

Fixes

* Improve the performance (i.e., reduce the overhead) of vector-valued ports ([#15431][_#15431], [#15432][_#15432], [#15470][_#15470])
* Narrow the LcmSubscriberSystem output port dependencies ([#15563][_#15563])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* TBD [solvers] Fix assertion in AddPositiveSemidefiniteConstraint ([#15580][_#15580])  # The symbolic transpose assertion was being incorrectly skipped, so we must rewrite the check to use CheckStructualEquality instead of operator==. The CheckStructualEquality doesn't work well with MatrixBase<Derived>, so we must rewrite the function to take a Ref, instead. (This is an improvement in any case; we over-use Derived in the MathematicalProgram API.) Also of note, with the Eigen 3.4 pre-release, the assertion was actually being compiled down to a bool, rather than skipped, leading to a type check error.
* TBD AddLorentzConeConstraint accept eval_type ([#15553][_#15553])
* TBD [solvers] Add IbexSolver ([#15552][_#15552])
New features

* MathematicalProgram can report its ProgramType enum ([#15340][_#15340])
* MathematicalProgram allows removing constraints ([#15350][_#15350])
* Many improvements to configurations for debugging:
  * Improve printing for Expression and Lorentz cone constraints ([#15472][_#15472]) ([#15475][_#15475])
  * GurobiSolver now support kPrintToConsole and kPrintFileName options ([#15497][_#15497])
  * GurobiSolver now supports GRBcomputeIIS and GRBwrite options ([#15438][_#15438])
  * IpoptSolver now supports the kPrintToConsole option ([#15502][_#15502])
  * MosekSolver now support kPrintToConsole and kPrintFileName options ([#15399][_#15399])
  * MosekSolver now supports writedata option ([#15568][_#15568])
  * OsqpSolver now supports the kPrintToConsole option ([#15501][_#15501])
  * SnoptSolver now supports the kPrintFileName option ([#15493][_#15493])
  * Solver options offers new sugar to get_print_to_console and get_print_file_name ([#15473][_#15473])
* Improvements to the new geometry/optimization module:
  * Make Point mutable ([#15368][_#15368])
  * Add ConvexSet::IntersectsWith ([#15372][_#15372])
  * Add HPolyhedron::CartesianPower ([#15371][_#15371])
  * Add GraphOfConvexSets ([#15413][_#15413])
  * Add IrisInConfigurationSpace ([#15476][_#15476])
  * Add SolveShortestPath to GraphOfConvexSets ([#15483][_#15483])
  * Add MinkowskiSum is-a ConvexSet ([#15543][_#15543])

Fixes

* Reject NaNs in Constraint bounds ([#15391][_#15391])
* Reject non-finite values in LinearConstraint A matrix ([#15391][_#15391])
* GurobiSolver throws when an option is set incorrectly ([#15412][_#15412])
* MosekSolver throws when an option is set incorrectly ([#15411][_#15411])

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

New features

* Add new CollisionFilterManager API for manipulating collision filters ([#15348][_#15348])
* Add ability to remove collision filters ([#15415][_#15415])
* Allow model_instances in MultibodyPlant CalcJacobianCenterOfMassTranslationalVelocity ([#15387][_#15387])
* New hydroelastic contact model in progress ([#15210][_#15210], [#15358][_#15358])

Fixes

* Improve hydroelastic spatial force visualization ([#15416][_#15416])
* Respect (renderer, accepting) for post-hoc renderers ([#15448][_#15448])
* Fix Eigen::Block use-after-free ([#15451][_#15451])
* Fix joint pose computation during sdformat parsing when using frames as joint parent or child ([#15290][_#15290])
* Fix URDFs included by SDFormat models to be parsed by Drake directly instead of via URDF->SDFormat conversion; now those URDFs can contain custom elements (e.g., drake:joint) and other URDF elements not supported by SDFormat (e.g., transmission) ([#15140][_#15140])
* SDFormat parsing reports warnings when fed certain kinds of unrecognized elements ([#15317][_#15317])

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* Include weld joint in Pendulum.urdf ([#15426][_#15426])

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* Add DARE overload that takes Q, R, and N cost matrices ([#15352][_#15352])
* Add Value::maybe_get_mutable_value ([#15418][_#15418])
* Give DrakeLcm the ability to defer launching its thread ([#15390][_#15390])
* Add ExtractDoubleOrThrow for Eigen::MatrixBase ([#15518][_#15518])
* Give SortedPair compatibility with structured bindings ([#15551][_#15551])

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD [pydrake] Disable memory_maps acceptance test on macOS ([#15589][_#15589])  # The psutil library does not offer memory_maps() on macOS, so we can't easily inspect the list of loaded libraries.
New features

* planar_scenegraph_visualizer uses SceneGraph API to visualize ([#15456][_#15456])

Fixes

* Support passing matrix coefficients to ZeroOrderHold and PiecewisePolynomial ([#15433][_#15433]) ([#15442][_#15442])
* Use template Binding_[{Type}] ([#15409][_#15409]) ([#15457][_#15457])
* Allow upcasting to Binding_[Constraint] ([#15408][_#15408])

* Reorder overall bindings for better Python type signatures ([#15410][_#15410])
* Preserve return type for mutable and const class methods ([#15507][_#15507])

Newly bound

* pydrake.multibody.parsing.PackageMap.Remove ([#15430][_#15430])
* pydrake.multibody.plant.MultibodyPlant.CalcMassMatrix ([#15520][_#15520])
* pydrake.solvers.mathematicalprogram.MathematicalProgram.AddCost(obj=...) ([#15400][_#15400])
* pydrake.systems.primitives.TrajectoryLinearSystem ([#15397][_#15397])

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* TBD [pydrake] Don't load native code upon 'import pydrake' ([#15585][_#15585])  # Wait until a native module is loaded (or a native function is called) before loading our shared libraries. This will make the forthcoming pydrake.lcmtypes more convenient to use without forcing a dependency on native code.
* TBD [pydrake] Various fixes in prep for pydrake.lcmtypes ([#15591][_#15591])  # Add native code bootstrapping to pydrake.visualization; missed in 9ff5cc1d408b1f408de126b44f0cb1e0a748d4e9.  (The sub-modules indirectly loaded native code, so this should not have been allow-listed as an expected pure-python module.) Enhance lcm.bzl to understand dots within lcm_package names; these need to turn into forward-slashes when used in filenames.  Add direct local acceptance testing for this macro. Remove stray lcmtypes import from meshcat_visualizer (and BUILD).
* TBD Add python and pip to Dockerfile to support running 20.04 notebooks on deepnote.com ([#15586][_#15586])  # The current images will not run on deepnote.  Adding these lines fulfills the requirements, as specified here: https://docs.deepnote.com/environment/custom-environments#custom-image-requirements To reproduce, I have uploaded the revised image to DockerHub as robotlocomotion/drake:pr15586-focal.  Visit https://deepnote.com/project/Drake-PR-15586-mPXpOqUZTqe8JBtfj5z4xQ/%2Fnotebook.ipynb .  You will need to create an account to proceed, I'm afraid.  Then - On the left menu, click on the Environment toolbar, and then look at the "Environment" dropdown. - I've connected 3 docker images: robotlocomotion/drake:bionic and robotlocomotion/drake:focal and robotlocomotion/drake:pr15586-focal - Confirm that selecting the two existing images will spend some time "Loading image..." but then will fail with `We failed to run the image you specified. Your image doesn’t exist, or we don’t have permissions to access it, or it doesn't fulfill the requirements to run.` - Confirm that selecting the revised image will load successfully. - For the revised image, run the first cell of the notebook, and see that pydrake loads successfully and prints the expected file path.
