title: Drake v0.33.0
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v0.32.0

* The ``drake/examples/pendulum/Pendulum.urdf`` now includes a weld joint ([#15426][_#15426]).
  * Users who were adding the weld by hand and should remove their weld.
* The ``drake::systems::lcm::SerializerInterface`` has a new pure-virtual method for ``Clone`` ([#15394][_#15394]).
  * Users who were extending it directly (rather than using the concrete ``Serializer`` class) should to implement the new method.
* The ``drake::geometry::GeometryState`` class no longer offers ``ExcludeCollisionsWithin`` and ``ExcludeCollisionBetween`` ([#15348][_#15348]).
  * This class (though not in an `internal` namespace yet) is documented to be for Drake's internal use only.

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->
