# Announcements

<!-- <relnotes for announcements go here> -->

* Drake now supports macOS 26 Tahoe ([#23851][_#23851]).
* Fix rendering energy loss in RenderEngineVtk ([#23811][_#23811]). Change VTK
  BRDF model from a single-scatter approximation to a multi-scatter
  approximation. This will have an immediate change on rendered outputs --
  images will be brighter. Also fix a bug with a prior lighting patch.
  * Current camera configurations will need to be updated, especially with
    respect to their exposure values and lighting levels. Renderings for which
    high exposure values seemed necessary will now seem oversaturated.
    Furthermore, with more energy coming from the environment map, lights may
    need to be brighter to have a comparable effect as before.
  * The lighting configuration tutorial has been updated accordingly.
* Add a flag to opt-in to the new AutoDiff implementation ([#23870][_#23870]).
  * CMake builds have a new flag that defaults to `DRAKE_USE_EIGEN_LEGACY_AUTODIFF=ON`.
  * Bazel builds have a new flag that defaults to `--@drake//tools/flags:use_eigen_legacy_autodiff=True`.
  * When `ON` / `True`, Drake uses `<unsupported/Eigen/AutoDiff>` for its autodiff support.
  * When `OFF` / `False`, Drake uses a custom re-implementation at `drake/common/ad/...`.
  * On 2026-04-01, both defaults will flip to `OFF` / `False`.
  * On 2026-07-01, support for `ON` / `True` will be removed.
  * Users should experiment with flipping the flag to `OFF` / `False` as soon as practical, to discover any problems early and file Drake issues when relevant.
