title: Drake v0.29.0
---

# Announcements

* None

# Breaking changes since v0.28.0

* The build rules for Drake's website and documentation were accidentally set
  to public visibility.  As part of our ongoing website improvements, we are
  reworking those rules and will be marking all of them as private.  Some of
  those changes are already present in this release.  Downstream software
  should not depend on Drake's documentation (the files under //doc/...).

## Newly-deprecated APIs

* drake::geometry::SignedDistanceToPointWithGradient ([#14793][_#14793])
* pydrake.multibody.plant.MultibodyPlant.WeldFrames kwargs names A and B ([#14805][_#14805])

* pydrake.solvers.mathematicalprogram.MathematicalProgram.NewNonnegativePolynomial kwarg name "grammian" ([#14790][_#14790])
* The @semantic_version external ([#14784][_#14784])
* The @sphinx external ([#14804][_#14804])

## Removal of deprecated items

* TBD [solvers,systems] Remove deprecated code 2021-04 ([#14846][_#14846])  # This commit only performs the trivial removals.  The more complicated removals will land in their own, separate commits.
* TBD lcmtypes: Remove deprecated messages 2021-04 ([#14842][_#14842])
* TBD [geometry,systems,examples] Deprecation - All things geometry ([#14855][_#14855])  # While this deprecation effort contains the normal deletion of deprecated API and its tests, it comes with a number of special cases -- some transitionary code had to be injected during the deprecation period between the old and new APIs. The explicit examples are called out below: - RenderEngine - The old API and new API were entangled such that derived RenderEngine types could overload either API and invoking one would eventually invoke the other. That mechanism has been removed and the default implementation now simply throws "not implemented" exceptions. - SceneGraph - SceneGraph went from storing GeometryState as abstract state to as an abstract Parameter. During transition, one could request the old behavior. That facility is now removed as well as the infrastructure that enabled it. Implicit is the removal of *two* headers (but the contents of those headers had already been completely deprecated).

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v0.27.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{bionic|focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Nightly Releases](/from_binary.html#nightly-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
