title: Drake v0.29.0
---

# Announcements

* None

# Breaking changes since v0.28.0

* The build rules for Drake's website and documentation were accidentally set
  to public visibility.  As part of our ongoing website improvements, we are
  reworking those rules and will be marking all of them as private.  Some of
  those changes are already present in this release.  Downstream software
  should not depend on Drake's documentation (the files under //doc/...).

# Changes since v0.28.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

* TBD [systems,tools,examples,lcmtypes,manipulation] Deprecate robotlocomotion_lcmtypes and bot2_core_lcmtypes ([#14884][_#14884])  # Port existing Drake code to use the new types. Add helper header systems/sensors/robotlocomotion_compat.h to alias the old names onto the new names, along with a deprecation warning.
New features

* Add limited support for integration of symbolic polynomials ([#14807][_#14807])
* DirectTranscription now supports continuous-time MultibodyPlant ([#14840][_#14840], [#14854][_#14854], [#14859][_#14859])

Fixes

* Improve diagram building performance when computing subsystem feedthrough maps ([#14788][_#14788])
* Fix infinite loop in discrete algebraic Riccati equation ([#14865][_#14865])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

New features

* Add [CLP solver](https://github.com/coin-or/Clp#clp) wrapper ([#14776][_#14776], [#14820][_#14820])

Fixes

* Fix constant term in SNOPT optimal cost ([#14809][_#14809])

## Multibody Dynamics

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD [geometry] Deprecate the "is grad unique" flag from query results ([#14875][_#14875])  # The flag reporting whether the gradient is unique had several problems: 1. It wasn't always valid (box and cylinder ignored questions of uniqueness when the query point was *inside*). 2. That information alone is not particularly actionable; it would be better to know the full space of valid vectors. 3. We have no code that actually makes use of this classifier (and no optimization code that even *can*). Therefore, we're not computing it correctly, not using it, and have no plans to do so, we'll simplify the code by deprecating and then removing this flag. The tests in proximitiy_engine_test are inherently redundant of the tests for the callback directly. These test haven't be triaged and culled yet, but for the purpose of this deprecation, it simply won't pay attention to whether or not the gradient is unique or not. NOTE: The python bindings for the query result never bound the boolean flag, means no deprecation effort is necessary in the bindings. * Deprecating vector is unique in SignedDistancePair Deprecate SignedDistancePair::is_nhat_BA_W_unique This follows logically from the deprecation of SignedDistanceToPoint::is_grad_W_unique. There are a couple of differences compared to the SigndDistanceToPoint deprecation. - is_nhat_BA_W_unique was bound in python bindings, so this includes deprecations in the bindings as well. - SignedDistancePair had a weird constructor that only existed for tests. Rather than trying to maintain a version into the future, the tests were reformulated so that the constructor is no longer called and it can simply be deprecated in anticipation of simple removal.
New features

* Add limited support for lumped parameter decomposition ([#14863][_#14863])
* Add ability to filter and convert GeometrySet into unordered_set\<GeometryId\> ([#14871][_#14871])

Fixes

* Rename confusing parameters of WeldJoint and WeldFrames ([#14805][_#14805])  
* GeometryPairContactWrenchEvaluatorBinding is now public, not internal ([#14835][_#14835])

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* Add a tutorial on debugging tips for MathematicalProgram ([#14815][_#14815])

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

* TBD Add renamed copies of RobotLocomotion/lcmtypes used by Drake ([#14885][_#14885])  # These are copied from https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/lcmtypes as of 821ff4b463a9cb8f616914d87289714fcb356a92, with edits to change the package and message names to match Drake conventions.

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->
