title: Drake v0.29.0
---

# Announcements

* TBD

# Breaking changes since v0.28.0

* TBD Build rules for the website are actively being reworked.  We are making them all private.

# Changes since v0.28.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* Add limited support for integration of symbolic polynomials ([#14807][_#14807])
* Add limited support for lumped parameter decomposision ([#14863][_#14863])
* DirectTranscription now supports continuous-time MultibodyPlant ([#14840][_#14840], [#14854][_#14854], [#14859][_#14859])

Fixes

* Improve diagram building performance when computing subsystem feedthrough maps ([#14788][_#14788])
* Fix infinite loop in discrete algebraic Riccati equation ([#14865][_#14865])

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

New features

* Add [CLP solver](https://github.com/coin-or/Clp#clp) wrapper ([#14776][_#14776], [#14820][_#14820])

Fixes

* Fix constant term in SNOPT optimal cost ([#14809][_#14809])

## Multibody Dynamics

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* TBD Remove unused distance_to_point_with_gradient ([#14793][_#14793])  # This includes the deprecation of the struct SignedDistanceToPointWithGradient. It's worth noting that the internal code is only exercised in its own unit test and that the deprecated struct is not part of any public API (either produced or consumed).
* TBD [multibody,tutorials] multibody: Rename parameters of WeldJoint() and WeldFrames() ([#14805][_#14805])  # Closes #14641. The parameter names were variously confusing (WeldFrames, see #14641) and/or inconsistent with other joints (WeldJoint constructor). This patch moves both entry points to use naming more consistent with other joint APIs and deprecates the old parameter names in python bindings.
* TBD Put GeometryPairContactWrenchEvaluatorBinding in the public namespace ([#14835][_#14835])
* TBD Add ability to convert GeometrySet into unordered_set<GeometryId> ([#14871][_#14871])  # The ability to convert also includes the ability to filter based on role. This includes the public-facing inspector API as well as the GeometryState implementation.

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* Add a tutorial on debugging tips for MathematicalProgram ([#14815][_#14815])

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception go here> -->

None

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* TBD pydrake: Expose some testing utilities to drake_bazel_external workflows ([#14812][_#14812])
* TBD Allow python binding of SignalLogger to log autodiffxd data ([#14823][_#14823])  # py primitives: Add template free function for LogOutput numpy_compare: Add assert_allclose
* TBD default_scalars_pybind: Consolidate CopyIfNotPodType functions ([#14839][_#14839])
* TBD bind all scalar types for wrap_to ([#14845][_#14845])

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

Newly bound

* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* Fix python3 search for CMake 3.10 on Ubuntu 18.04 ([#14798][_#14798])
* Improve compatibility with Eigen 3.4.0 pre-release for not_equal_strict on symbolic expressions ([#14868][_#14868])

## Build dependencies

* Add ignition_utils 1.0.0 for use by sdformat 11.0.0 ([#14853][_#14853])
* Add opencl in anticipation of future use ([#14843][_#14843])
* Add python-tk@3.9 on macOS to track homebrew split ([#14832][_#14832])
* Add python3-semantic-version (on Ubuntu) or semantic-version (on macOS) ([#14784][_#14784])
* Upgrade ghc_filesystem to latest release 1.5.4 ([#14851][_#14851])
* Upgrade ignition_math to latest release 6.8.0 ([#14848][_#14848])
* Upgrade pycodestyle to latest release 2.7.0 ([#14850][_#14850])
* Upgrade rules_pkg to latest release 0.4.0 ([#14867][_#14867])
* Upgrade tinyobjloader to latest commit ([#14866][_#14866])
* Upgrade voxelized_geometry_tools to latest commit ([#14843][_#14843])

## Newly-deprecated APIs

* TBD [tools,doc] workspace: Deprecate the @sphinx repository ([#14804][_#14804])  # Our documentation tools are Ubuntu-only, so we don't need to ask Bazel to locate the correct binary -- we can just hard-code it.

## Removal of deprecated items

* TBD [solvers,systems] Remove deprecated code 2021-04 ([#14846][_#14846])  # This commit only performs the trivial removals.  The more complicated removals will land in their own, separate commits.
* TBD lcmtypes: Remove deprecated messages 2021-04 ([#14842][_#14842])
* TBD [geometry,systems,examples] Deprecation - All things geometry ([#14855][_#14855])  # While this deprecation effort contains the normal deletion of deprecated API and its tests, it comes with a number of special cases -- some transitionary code had to be injected during the deprecation period between the old and new APIs. The explicit examples are called out below: - RenderEngine - The old API and new API were entangled such that derived RenderEngine types could overload either API and invoking one would eventually invoke the other. That mechanism has been removed and the default implementation now simply throws "not implemented" exceptions. - SceneGraph - SceneGraph went from storing GeometryState as abstract state to as an abstract Parameter. During transition, one could request the old behavior. That facility is now removed as well as the infrastructure that enabled it. Implicit is the removal of *two* headers (but the contents of those headers had already been completely deprecated).

# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/v0.27.0) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{bionic|focal|mac}.tar.gz``. See [Nightly Releases](/from_binary.html#nightly-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
