* Support continuous joint when parsing SDFormat ([#17956][_#17956])

* Compliant hydroelastic non-convex mesh in ProximityEngine ([#17837][_#17837])

Fixes

* Fix/improve OBB hierarchy construction ([#17937][_#17937])

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* TBD

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* The manipulation_station now uses DifferentialInverseKinematicsIntegrator ([#17899][_#17899])
* Switch tutorials hosting to Ubuntu 22.04 ([#18000][_#18000])

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [perception] Implement PointCloud::FlipNormalsTowardPoint ([#17922][_#17922])  # Towards https://github.com/RussTedrake/manipulation/issues/130
* [fix] TBD [pydrake] Fix keep_alive annotation on BuildIiwaControl ([#17984][_#17984])  # Also promote `make_arm_controller_model` to be bazel-public visibility.
* [feature] TBD [common,tools,doc,workspace] Use C++20 on macOS and Ubuntu 22 ([#17943][_#17943])
* [fix] TBD [manipulation,examples,multibody] [planner] Clean up formulation of Differential IK ([#17977][_#17977])
* [feature] TBD Support end-effector velocity limits in DiffIK and integrate through kStuck ([#18021][_#18021])  # Adds end-effector velocity limits for the entry point which takes a desired pose. DiffIKIntegrator now continues to integrate even if DiffIK reports kStuck. Previously, kStuck (which means small velocity commands) resulted in the integrator commanding exactly zero velocity. This meant it was effectively impossible to get unstuck using DiffIK. The only reason for this before was because DiffIK did not return joint velocities when it was kStuck; but that limitaiton was resolved with my last PR. Also adds a few minor improvements to the differential inverse kinematics tools: - Minor touch-ups / todos in the documentation. - Use the desired pose entry point in DiffIKIntegrator. - Strengthens the TestLinearObjective test. These changes will not impact the behavior for current users of DoDifferentialInverseKinematics; they only add new options.
