on API changes.

# Changes since v1.8.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->

New features

* [feature] TBD [systems,geometry] Allow specification of render engine type in CameraConfig ([#17927][_#17927])  # 1. SceneGraph has to support a query to acquire the type name of an existing render engine. 2. render_gl/factory.h now provides a const reporting whether the engine is available or not. - Incidentally cleaned up erroneous documentation. 3. ApplyCameraConfig extends its logic to instantiate RenderEngines. - Uses the new SceneGraph API and constexpr bool kHasGl. - Implements default render engine type, handles availability of RenderEngineGl, and throws for any inconsistent act.

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

New features

* [feature] TBD Construct EvaluatorCost as a linear transformation of another evaluator ([#18030][_#18030])

Fixes

* TBD

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

New features

* [feature] TBD [IRIS] New termination conditions for IrisInConfigurationSpace ([#17987][_#17987])
* [feature] TBD Shape specifications get vectorized constructors ([#17983][_#17983])
* [feature] TBD [geometry,workspace] [meshcat] Allow keyboard events to move sliders and click buttons ([#17947][_#17947])  # . This will enable, for instance, keyboard teleop through Meshcat. It will make the Deepnote teleop demos much more ergonomic. Upgrades meshcat to the latest commit to get this feature. To see the new features, `bazel run //geometry:meshcat_manual_test`. The last prompt (starting with "I've added two buttons..." will now ask you to press keys in addition to using the gui button / slider for the interaction.
* [feature] TBD [geometry] Compliant hydroelastic non-convex mesh in ProximityEngine ([#17837][_#17837])  # - Furthermore, treat a compliant hydroelastic (possibly non-convex) drake::geometry::Mesh as a rigid object when it makes contact with deformable geometries. This is accomplished through calling ProcessGeometriesForDeformableContact(mesh, user_data) from ImplementGeometry(const Mesh& mesh, void* user_data) in ProximityEngine. - Allow rigid hydroelastic non-convex mesh from VTK file by extracting surface mesh from the volume mesh in VTK file.
* [feature] TBD [parsing] Support continuous joint when parsing SDFormat ([#17956][_#17956])

Fixes

* [fix] TBD Add DoGetOnePosition and DoGetOneVelocity to ScrewJoint ([#18039][_#18039])  # Apply clang-formatting changes as well
* [fix] TBD Improve/fix obb hierarchy construction ([#17937][_#17937])  # We fit an OBB to a mesh (or cluster of features) using PCA analysis. It provides a reasonable estimate of a good OBB orientation. We have an optimization step that attempts to create a *better* orientation (and, thereby, a better fit). To optimize, we compute the partial derivative of OBB volume w.r.t. orientation of the box. Previously, it was possible for that partial to have *zero* magnitude. This led to failures because the optimization algorithm would end up with infinite values (which could, in turn, lead to NaN values). So, we have to protect ourselves against that. But beyond that, if the magnitude of the partial derivative is sufficiently small, there's really very little value in trying to further optimize the fit. So, we apply a threshold test for optimization to skip the effort if it doesn't seem worth it, and protect ourselves from introducing bad inf and NaN values. Incidentally, also moved the constructor to the .cc file where it belonged all along.
* [fix] TBD [geometry/optimization] Fix corner case in HPolyhedron::UniformSample ([#17982][_#17982])  # Previously, it was possible for the sampler to happily return points outside of the region, if the polytope was overspecified (points outside of the set where still inside some redudant half-planes). This provides the fix and adds a test.
* [fix] TBD [geometry/optimization] Improve GraphOfConvexSets handling of infeasible problems ([#17974][_#17974])

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Tutorials and examples

<!-- <relnotes for examples,tutorials go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [examples/manipulation_station] Use DifferentialInverseKinematicsIntegrator ([#17899][_#17899])

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

<!-- <relnotes for common,math,lcm,lcmtypes,manipulation,perception,visualization go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [perception] Implement PointCloud::FlipNormalsTowardPoint ([#17922][_#17922])  # Towards https://github.com/RussTedrake/manipulation/issues/130
* [fix] TBD [pydrake] Fix keep_alive annotation on BuildIiwaControl ([#17984][_#17984])  # Also promote `make_arm_controller_model` to be bazel-public visibility.
* [feature] TBD [common,tools,doc,workspace] Use C++20 on macOS and Ubuntu 22 ([#17943][_#17943])
* [fix] TBD [manipulation,examples,multibody] [planner] Clean up formulation of Differential IK ([#17977][_#17977])
* [feature] TBD Support end-effector velocity limits in DiffIK and integrate through kStuck ([#18021][_#18021])  # Adds end-effector velocity limits for the entry point which takes a desired pose. DiffIKIntegrator now continues to integrate even if DiffIK reports kStuck. Previously, kStuck (which means small velocity commands) resulted in the integrator commanding exactly zero velocity. This meant it was effectively impossible to get unstuck using DiffIK. The only reason for this before was because DiffIK did not return joint velocities when it was kStuck; but that limitaiton was resolved with my last PR. Also adds a few minor improvements to the differential inverse kinematics tools: - Minor touch-ups / todos in the documentation. - Use the desired pose entry point in DiffIKIntegrator. - Strengthens the TestLinearObjective test. These changes will not impact the behavior for current users of DoDifferentialInverseKinematics; they only add new options.

## Build dependencies

<!-- <relnotes for workspace go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade petsc to latest release v3.17.4 ([#17953][_#17953])
* [fix] TBD [workspace,multibody] [workspace] Upgrade sdformat_internal to latest release 13.0.0 ([#17913][_#17913])  # Upgrade gz_utils_internal to latest release 2.0.0. Upgrade gz_math_internal to latest release 7.0.2.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade mypy_internal to latest commit ([#18022][_#18022])  # Give up on the TODO for using mypy stable releases. Generally it looks like we're going to need bleeding-edge features.

* [fix] TBD [workspace] Update qdldl to latest release 0.1.6 ([#18034][_#18034])  # Even though the README advises not to upgrade qdldl past osqp's pin of qdldl (currently near 0.1.5), the changes from 0.1.5 to 0.1.6 are only to the build system so we might as well take them now to make any future feature-rich upgrades easier. Adjust github paths to match relocated qdldl and osqp repositories. Opt-in to strict mode for cmake configure variables.
