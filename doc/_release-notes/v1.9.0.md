title: Drake v1.9.0
date: 2022-10-09
released: 2022-10-09
---

# Announcements

* Drake now supports the macOS arm64 architecture (the "M1", "M2", ... CPU
  series) without using Rosetta.
  * Drake does not yet provide pypi wheels for arm64 (follow [#17906](_#17906)
    for updates). In the meantime, we recommend that you install from a
    [Direct Download](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) that includes both Python
    and C++ support, using a dedicated virtual environment.
* Preliminary support for ROS 2â„¢ is underway
  [here](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-ros) ([#17941][_#17941]).
* Differential IK has been substantially improved
  ([#9773][_#9773], [#17977][_#17977], [#18021][_#18021]).
* Drake builds in C++20 mode by default on macOS and Ubuntu 22 ([#17943][_#17943]).
  * Ubuntu 20 is unchanged (C++17 mode).

# Breaking changes since v1.8.0

* We have elected to remove support for Ibex from IRIS; it proved to only be
  useful for exceptionally toy problems and has become a footgun for users that
  turn it on (and wait forever) ([#17987][_#17987]).
  * In particular, the drake::geometry::optimization::IrisOptions::enable_ibex
    flag (which defaulted to false) has been removed.

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.
