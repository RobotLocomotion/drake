# Notes


This release provides [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases/tag/{version}) named
``drake-YYYYMMDD-{{bionic|focal|mac}}.tar.gz``. See [Stable Releases](/from_binary.html#stable-releases) for instructions on how to use them.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of [SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html). Thanks to
Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.
