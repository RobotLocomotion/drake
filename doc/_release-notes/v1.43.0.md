date: 2099-12-31
released: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Announcements

* New differential inverse kinematics *systems* have been introduced: `DifferentialInverseKinematicsSystem` and `DifferentialInverseKinematicsController` (with pydrake bindings). This is a more flexible, framework-friendly implementation of differential inverse kinematics.

# Breaking changes since v1.42.0

* TBD

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
on API changes.

# Changes since v1.42.0

## Dynamical Systems

<!-- <relnotes for systems go here> -->


New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [solvers,workspace] Update Mosek to 11.0.24 ([#23151][_#23151])  # In order to allow wheels to use Mosek provided from PyPI without version support regressions, we need to use a newer version of Mosek (in particular, 11.x). Therefore, update Mosek to the latest version currently available. Also remove support for x86 macOS, which is not supported by Mosek 11.
New features

* Overload MathematicalProgram::AddLinearEqualityConstraint for vector of formulas ([#23157][_#23157])
