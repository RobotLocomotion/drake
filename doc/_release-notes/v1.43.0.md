New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Mathematical Program

<!-- <relnotes for solvers go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Bind MathematicalProgram::AddCost for argument of type Binding<Cost> ([#23152][_#23152])
* [feature] TBD Overload of MathematicalProgram::AddLinearEqualityConstraint for vector of formulas ([#23157][_#23157])
* [fix] TBD Improves the efficiency of RemoveVertex from O(num edges in graph) to O(num edges connected to removed vertex) ([#23165][_#23165])

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Multibody Dynamics and Geometry

<!-- <relnotes for geometry,multibody go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Add python wrapper for volume mesh refinement ([#23083][_#23083])
* [fix] TBD Fixes bug in mirroring glTF files with RenderEngineVtk ([#23108][_#23108])  # Rotation and scale were being concatenated in the wrong way specifically for glTF files. This corrects and documents it, updating the tests accordingly.
* [fix] TBD Move Aabb and Obb out of internal namespace ([#23120][_#23120])
* [newly deprecated feature] TBD Updated revolute spring stiffness and nominal angle to be parameters ([#23146][_#23146])
* [fix] TBD Revisit the near-rigid regime for implicit PD constraints ([#23115][_#23115])
* [feature] TBD Copy files from anzu ([#23175][_#23175])  # Co-author: Aditya Bhat <aditya.bhat@tri.global> Co-author: Jeremy Nimmer <jeremy.nimmer@tri.global> Co-author: Rick Poyner <rick.poyner@tri.global>
* [feature] TBD Configure for Drake's build ([#23175][_#23175])

New features

## Planning

<!-- <relnotes for planning go here> -->

* [feature] TBD [planning,solvers] Implement the IrisNp2 algorithm for computing collision-free polytopes in configuration space ([#23001][_#23001])
* [feature] TBD Allow the user to specify the solver to be used by IrisNp2 for the counterexample search program ([#23101][_#23101])  # Also warn the user if the solver is failing frequently, and suggest using IpoptSolver in this case. Also change the convex configuration space test to use IPOPT instead of SNOPT for speed reasons.
* [feature] TBD Further use parallelization within IrisZo ([#23097][_#23097])  # This PR parallelizes calling the parameterization function if possible, and adds parallelization to checking for redundant particles.
* [feature] TBD Option for IrisNP2 and IrisZo to compute separating hyperplanes for particles in collision in the last inner iteration, even if that iteration already passed the collision-free probabilistic test ([#23102][_#23102])
* [fix] TBD Remove an extra sampling step that was potentially slowing the algorithm down ([#23127][_#23127])
* [feature] TBD Allow the user to draw samples in parallel in IrisZo and IrisNp2 ([#23111][_#23111])
* [feature] TBD [planning,solvers] Support positive padding in IrisNp2 ([#23118][_#23118])

New features

* TBD

## Miscellaneous features and fixes

## pydrake bindings

<!-- <relnotes for bindings go here> -->

* [feature] TBD Implement Python Bindings for IrisNp2 ([#23096][_#23096])  # * Implement python bindings for IrisNp2. * Set options.sampled_iris_options.max_separating_planes_per_iteration for speed purposes in the python tests. * Fix python documentation generation bug.
* [feature] TBD Implement missing bindings for GlobalInverseKinematics ([#23122][_#23122])

New features

* TBD

Fixes

* TBD

## Build system

<!-- <relnotes for cmake,doc,setup,third_party,tools go here> -->

* [fix] TBD [tools,workspace,geometry,setup,doc] [setup] Switch Noble's preferred Clang to clang-19 ([#23124][_#23124])  # Suppress some new warnings that show up.
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade python venv (mac) to latest ([#23139][_#23139])
* [fix] TBD [build] Pass a more specific compiler from CMake to Bazel ([#23117][_#23117])  # Add a Bazel flag to opt in to tweaking compiler-specific flags, so that CMake can use it when checking against CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID. This allows Linux CMake users to inherit Bazel's cc_toolchain logic without having to specify CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER (notably, when the compiler is 'cc'/'c++').
* [fix] TBD [workspace] Upgrade bazel to latest release 8.3.1 ([#23164][_#23164])
* TBD
