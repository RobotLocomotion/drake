title: Drake v1.43.0
date: 2025-07-17
released: 2025-07-17

# Announcements

* New differential inverse kinematics *systems* have been introduced: `DifferentialInverseKinematicsSystem` and `DifferentialInverseKinematicsController` (with pydrake bindings). This is a more flexible, framework-friendly implementation of differential inverse kinematics.
* We've removed examples/manipulation_station (both C++ and bindings). See https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/robot.html for the newer, preferred implementation.

# Breaking changes since v1.42.0

* None

Refer to our [Drake Stability Guidelines](/stable.html) for our policy
