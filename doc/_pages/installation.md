As you are exploring, you should also review
[What's Available from Python](/python_bindings.html#whats-available-from-python).

# Choose an installation method

You can choose to download a pre-compiled version of Drake, or to build it from source. The pre-compiled versions are much easier to use, but the source version is easier to update and will make it easier for you to contribute your fixes/improvements.
