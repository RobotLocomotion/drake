We assume that you have already installed:

* Xcode 10 or above ([from the Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835))

Prerequisite setup is otherwise automated. Simply run:

```
./setup/mac/install_prereqs.sh
```

After running the script, return to [Source installation](/from_source.html) to complete and test your
installation.
