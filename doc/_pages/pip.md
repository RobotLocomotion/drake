# Pip Packages

Drake publishes pre-compiled binaries as
[PyPI wheel packages](https://pypi.org/project/drake/).  Refer to
[Supported Configurations](/installation.html#supported-configurations)
for additional compatibility details.  Drake wheels require a `pip`
version of `pip >= 20.3`.

To learn about other installation methods, refer to
[Installation and Quickstart](/installation.html).

If you experience any problems with or have questions about Drake, please
[ask for help](/getting_help.html).

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of
[SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html).
Thanks to Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.

Drake's pip packages do not support the Gurobi solver. To use
Gurobi, you will need to build Drake from source following the instructions
in [Source Installation](/from_source.html).

## Stable Releases

<div class="note" markdown="1">
Drake is not tested regularly with Anaconda, so if you are using Anaconda you
may experience compatibility hiccups; when asking for help, be sure to mention
that Conda is involved.
</div>

We recommend installing drake into a
[virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)
directory.  In the example below, we will name that directory ``env``, but you
can choose any name.

For macOS, ensure that you're using Homebrew Python (not Apple's system Python).

Create a virtual environment, install Drake, and activate the environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
env/bin/pip install drake
source env/bin/activate
````

Refer to [Quickstart](/installation.html#quickstart) for next steps.

## Nightly Releases

Wheel packages for Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy) and macOS are
published nightly at a [PEP 503](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/) index url
[https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/whl/nightly/](https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/whl/nightly/).

- Nightly wheel version numbers are created as `0.0.YYYYMMDD`, e.g.,
  `0.0.20240221` for February 21st, 2024.
- Nightly wheel packages are retained for 56 days from their date of creation,
  and drop out of the index after 48 days.

To install a specific nightly wheel using `pip`, replace `YYYYMMDD` with the
desired date:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
env/bin/pip install \
    --extra-index-url https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/whl/nightly/ \
    'drake==0.0.YYYYMMDD'
source env/bin/activate
```

Or, to install today's most recent nightly wheel using `pip`, specify `<0.1`
instead of `==0.0.YYYYMMDD` as shown below:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
env/bin/pip install \
    --extra-index-url https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/whl/nightly/ \
    'drake<0.1'
source env/bin/activate
```
