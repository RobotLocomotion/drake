title: How to get notifications for “drake”-tagged Stackoverflow questions
---

(Set up a Stackoverflow account if you don't already have one.)

1. Go to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
2. Click on your profile picture (upper right).
3. Select "Edit profile and settings".
4. Under "EMAIL SETTINGS", select "Question subscriptions".
   * (This will take you to StackExchange.)
5. Look for "Filtered questions" at the top; select that.
   * If you don't see it, look for "Log in" and make sure
     you are logged in to StackExchange as well as StackOverflow.
   * After logging in, select "Filtered questions".
6. Click on "New filter", which brings up a form.
7. On the form: 
   * Pick "Just questions tagged with the ____ tag." and type "drake".
   * Keep the default "All sites"; don't select "Add rule".
   * Choose a name for your filter, like "Drake questions".
   * Request notification to your email, and pick a frequency. Consider
     the shortest delay so users can get quick answers -- you can always
     make it longer later if it is bothering you.
8. Click "Save changes".
9. You should receive an email confirmation with a subject like
   "Confirm your filter subscription - StackExchange"
