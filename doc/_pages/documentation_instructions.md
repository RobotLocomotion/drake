title: Documentation Generation Instructions
---

This page contains instructions on how to locally regenerate Drake's website.

The website infrastructure uses a combination of
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the
[main site](https://drake.mit.edu/) and
[Style Guide](https://drake.mit.edu/styleguide/cppguide.html),
[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) for the
[C++ API reference](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/), and
[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) for the
[Python API reference](https://drake.mit.edu/pydrake/).

# Prerequisites

Documentation generation and preview as described in this document are
supported on Ubuntu **22.04** only.

Before getting started, install Drake's prerequisites with the additional
``--with-doc-only`` command line option, i.e.:

```sh
$ sudo setup/ubuntu/install_prereqs.sh --with-doc-only
```

# Previewing changes

To easily preview your changes, run the ``//doc:build --serve`` command.

```sh
# Read the usage message.
$ bazel run //doc:build -- --help

# Preview the entire site, exactly how it will appear online.
$ bazel run //doc:build -- --serve

# Speed up the preview by only processing certain tool(s):
$ bazel run //doc:pages             -- --serve  # Only the main site.
$ bazel run //doc/doxygen_cxx:build -- --serve  # Only the C++ API reference.
$ bazel run //doc/pydrake:build     -- --serve  # Only the Python API reference.
$ bazel run //doc/styleguide:build  -- --serve  # Only the Style Guide.

# Further speed up preview generating only some API modules, e.g., math:
$ bazel run //doc/doxygen_cxx:build -- --serve drake.math            # C++ math API.
$ bazel run //doc/pydrake:build     -- --serve pydrake.math          # Python math API.
$ bazel run //doc:build             -- --serve {drake,pydrake}.math  # Both at once.

# Further speed up preview by omitting expensive `dot` graphs (C++ API only):
$ bazel run //doc/doxygen_cxx:build -- --serve --quick drake.math
````

To preview using a local branch of the styleguide instead of our pinned
revision, be sure to set the
[local_repository_override](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/tools/workspace/README.md#exploring-github_archive-changes-from-a-local-clone)
option in ``drake/tools/workspace/styleguide/repository.bzl`` before running
the preview command.

# Testing locally

The website is not part of Drake's default local build nor tests, because it
requires heavy prerequisites to be installed (see ``--with-doc-only`` above).
Therefore, a simple ``bazel test //...`` will not provide any feedback about
local documentation edits.

To check locally that documentation changes pass all build and test rules, run:

<!-- Don't use "sh" literal mode here; it mis-colors the "test" non-keyword. -->
```
$ bazel test //doc/... //doc:manual_tests
```

# Testing in CI

Only the Jenkins builds whose name ends with ``-documentation`` will run the
documentation build steps and related tests.  By default, those builds run on
the Continuous (i.e., post-merge) and Nightly schedules, not on pull requests.
If you would like to check Jenkins results on a pull request, you need to
[schedule an on-demand build](/jenkins.html#scheduling-an-on-demand-build)
by posting a comment

# Advanced Building

This section contains details aimed at documentation infrastructure
maintainers.

There are in fact five available commands:

```sh
$ bazel run //doc:build               # Entire website (i.e., all of the below).
$ bazel run //doc:pages               # Main site only.
$ bazel run //doc/doxygen_cxx:build   # C++ API reference subdir only.
$ bazel run //doc/pydrake:build       # Python API reference subdir only.
$ bazel run //doc/styleguide:build    # Style Guide subdir only.
```

The first command provides options to rebuild subsets of the website, and so
offers one-stop shopping for developers, as explained in the prior section.
The latter commands are used for focused regression testing, and might be
more convenient while modifying the documentation tooling, or to avoid
spurious Bazel dependencies.

Each build command can be run in either "generate" mode (writing the files into
a scratch folder) or "serve" mode (http serving for web browser preview).  The
automated website deployment pipeline uses the former; most developers will use
the latter.

Each build command has a corresponding test defined as part of the
``//doc:manual_tests`` test suite.
