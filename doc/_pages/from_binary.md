Individual packages are archived two years from their date of creation.

Example usages of these binaries are shown in this [example CMake project](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-external-examples/tree/master/drake_cmake_installed).
For the compilers used to produce these releases, see [Binary Packages](/developers.html#binary-packages).
If you are unsure of which approach to use, we suggest you [build from source](/from_source.html)
instead.

For using Python bindings, see [Binary Installation for Python](/python_bindings.html#installation).

You may also use these binary releases in Docker images. See [Using the Drake Docker Images From Docker Hub](/docker.html)
for more information.

Drake binary releases incorporate a pre-compiled version of
[SNOPT](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~optimizers/solvers/snopt/) as part of the
[Mathematical Program toolbox](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html).
Thanks to Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.

Drake maintainers may build "experimental" packages on demand using Jenkins by
following [these instructions](/jenkins.html#building-binary-packages-on-demand).

# Historical Note

Older releases were built around substantial MATLAB support, and are
described on [release notes page](/release_notes/older_releases.html).
