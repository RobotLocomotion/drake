Release Playbook
****************

This document explains the steps related to publishing a version-numbered Drake
binary release.  It is intended only for use by the few Drake Developer experts
who regularly handle the release process.

We publish a minor release approximately once per month in the middle of the
calendar month, with version number is ``v0.N.0`` where ``N`` is monotonically
increasing.

Minor releases
==============

Begin this process around 1 week prior to the intended release date.

Prior to release
----------------

1. Choose the next version number.
2. Create a local Drake branch named ``release_notes-v0.N.0`` (so that others
   can easily find and push to it after the PR is opened).
3. As the first commit on the branch, mimic the commit
   (`link <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/pull/14208/commits/674b84877bc08448b59a2243f3b910a7b6dbab43>`_)
   from `PR 14208 <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/pull/14208>`_
   in order to disable CI.  A quick way to do this might be::

     git fetch upstream pull/14208/head
     git cherry-pick 674b84877bc08448b59a2243f3b910a7b6dbab43

4. Push that branch and then open a new pull request titled::

     doc: Add release notes v0.N.0

   Make sure that "Allow edits from maintainers" on the GitHub PR page is
   enabled (the checkbox is checked).
5. For release notes, on an ongoing basis, add recent commit messages to the
   release notes draft using the ``tools/dev/relnotes`` tooling.  (Instructions
   for using ``relnotes`` are found atop its source code.)

   a. On the first run, use ``--action=create`` to bootstrap the file.
      Be sure to cite the new file from the list in ``doc/release_notes.rst``.
   b. On the subsequent runs, use ``--action=update`` to refresh the file.

6. For release notes, on an ongoing basis, clean up and relocate the commit
   notes to properly organized and wordsmithed bullet points.
7. From time to time, merge ``upstream/master`` into your
   ``origin/release_notes-v0.N.0`` branch (so that it doesn't go stale).
   Never rebase or force-push to the branch.  We expect that several people
   will clone and push to it concurrently.
8. As the release is nearly ready, post a call for action for feature teams to
   look at the draft document and provide suggestions (in reviewable) or fixes
   (as pushes).

   a. To help ensure that the "newly deprecated APIs" section is accurate, grep
      the code for ``YYYY-MM-01`` deprecation notations, for the ``MM`` values
      that would have been associated with our +3 months typical period.

Polishing the release notes
---------------------------

Here are some guidelines for bringing commit notes from the relnotes tool into
the main body of the document:

* Many commit messages can be cut down to their summary strings and used as-is.
* Expand all acronyms (eg, MBP -> MultibodyPlant, SG -> SceneGraph).
* Commits can be omitted if they only affect tests or non-installed examples.
  TODO(jwnimmer-tri) Explain how to check if something is installed.
* In general you should mention removed classes and methods using their exact
  name (for easier searching).

  * In the pydrake and deprecation sections in fact you can just put the
    fully-qualified name as the whole line item; the meaning is clear from
    context.
  * This may mean having a long list of items for a single commit.  That is
    fine.

* We have four common grammatical forms for our commit messages:

  * Past tense ("Added new method foo") is acceptable
  * Noun phrase ("Ability to foo the bar") is acceptable
  * Imperative ("Add new method foo", i.e. PEP-8 style) is acceptable
  * Present tense ("Adds new method foo", i.e. Google styleguide style) is
    discouraged

* Use exactly the same wording for the boilerplate items:

  * Every dependency upgrade line should be "Upgrade libfoobar to latest
    release 1.2.3" or "Upgrade funrepo to latest commit".
  * Dependencies should be referred to by their workspace name.

* Some features under development (eg, hydroelastic as of this writing) may
  have no-release-notes policies, as their APIs although public are not yet
  fully supported.  Be sure to take note of which these are, or ask on
  #platform_review slack

Cutting the release
-------------------

6. Find a plausible build to use

   a. Make sure https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Production/ is clean
   b. Make sure https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Nightly%20Production/
      has nothing still running (modulo the ``*-coverage`` builds, which we can
      ignore)
   c. Take
      https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Packaging/job/mac-mojave-unprovisioned-clang-bazel-nightly-snopt-packaging/
      and
      https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Packaging/job/linux-bionic-unprovisioned-gcc-bazel-nightly-snopt-packaging/
      and
      https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Packaging/job/linux-focal-unprovisioned-gcc-bazel-nightly-snopt-packaging/
      builds for that night and make sure they share the same git sha (``HEAD``
      from the moment they were launched).  Note it.

      i. If the git sha for all three does not match, wait and try again
         tomorrow night.

   d. Check the logs for those packaging builds and find the URLs they posted
      to.  It will be ``YYYYMMDD`` with today's date (they kick off after
      midnight).  Note it.

      i. N.B. The packaging script uploads the file twice, with two different
         names.  One is ``YYYYMMDD`` and one is ``latest``.  We will use the
         ``YYYYMMDD`` one.

7. Update the release notes to have the ``YYYYMMDD`` we choose, and to make
   sure that the nightly build git sha from the prior step matches the
   ``newest_commit`` whose changes are enumerated in the notes.
8. Prepare the binaries

   a. Make a local folder, maybe ``$HOME/tmp/v0.N.0``
   b. Fetch all the things (
      https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Packaging/job/mac-mojave-unprovisioned-clang-bazel-nightly-snopt-packaging/
      and
      https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Packaging/job/linux-bionic-unprovisioned-gcc-bazel-nightly-snopt-packaging/
      and
      https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Packaging/job/linux-focal-unprovisioned-gcc-bazel-nightly-snopt-packaging/)

      i. ``wget https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/drake/nightly/drake-YYYYMMDD-bionic.tar.gz``
      ii. ``wget https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/drake/nightly/drake-YYYYMMDD-bionic.tar.gz.sha512``
      iii. ``wget https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/drake/nightly/drake-YYYYMMDD-focal.tar.gz``
      iv. ``wget https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/drake/nightly/drake-YYYYMMDD-focal.tar.gz.sha512``
      v. ``wget https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/drake/nightly/drake-YYYYMMDD-mac.tar.gz``
      vi. ``wget https://drake-packages.csail.mit.edu/drake/nightly/drake-YYYYMMDD-mac.tar.gz.sha512``

   c. Checksums

      i. ``sha512sum -c *.sha512``
      ii. ``sha256sum drake-YYYYMMDD-bionic.tar.gz >  drake-YYYYMMDD-bionic.tar.gz.sha256``
      iii. ``sha256sum drake-YYYYMMDD-focal.tar.gz >  drake-YYYYMMDD-focal.tar.gz.sha256``
      iv. ``sha256sum drake-YYYYMMDD-mac.tar.gz >  drake-YYYYMMDD-mac.tar.gz.sha256``
      v. ``sha256sum -c *.sha256``

9. Merge the release notes PR

   a. After merge, go to https://drake-jenkins.csail.mit.edu/view/Documentation/job/linux-bionic-gcc-bazel-nightly-documentation/ and push "Build now".

      i. If you don't have "Build now" click "Log in" first in upper right.

10. Open https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/releases and choose "Draft a
    new release".  Note that this page does has neither history nor undo.  Be
    slow and careful!

    a. Tag version is: v0.N.0
    b. Target is: [the git sha from above]
    c. Release title is: Drake v0.N.0
    d. The body of the release should be forked from the prior release (open the
       prior release's web page and click "Edit" to get the markdown), with
       appropriate edits as follows:

       i. The version number

    e. Into the box labeled "Attach binaries by dropping them here or selecting
       them.", drag and drop the 9 release binary artifacts from above (the 3
       tarballs, and their 6 checksums)
    f. Choose "Save draft" and take a deep breath.

11. Once the documentation build finishes, release!

    a. Check that the link to drake.mit.edu docs from the GitHub release draft
       page actually works.
    b. Click "Publish release"
    c. Party on, Wayne.
