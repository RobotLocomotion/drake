TODO(russt): make this a table with different algorithms, too.

We have a number of use cases demonstrated under drake/examples in the
[source tree](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/examples), and
more available through our [Drake Gallery](/gallery.html) (contributions welcome!).

We also have a number of [examples of using Drake as a external library](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-external-examples)
in your own projects, including examples with various build systems and
examples of how you might set up continuous integration.
