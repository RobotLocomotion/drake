We have Python tutorials that can be previewed and executed as Jupyter
notebooks online with no need for local installation. You can use Binder to
preview and execute the notebooks (but startup time may be long), or you can
use nbviewer to only preview the notebook (where startup time is fast):

<div class="aside">
    <a target="_doc" href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RobotLocomotion/drake/nightly-release-binder?filepath=tutorials">
      <img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg"/>
    </a>
    <a target="_doc" href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/nightly-release/tutorials/">
      <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/view%20on-nbviewer-brightgreen.svg"/>
    </a>
</div>

If you are browsing on nbviewer, you may click on the Binder button
at the top-right of the page.

You may find more information about how to run these locally with Jupyter,
the branch the tutorials use, how they are published to Binder, etc., in
[drake/tutorials/README.md.](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/tutorials/README.md)
