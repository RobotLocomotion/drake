Introduction
============

This page contains notes on how to use
`Sublime Text <https://www.sublimetext.com>`_ with Drake.

Packages
========

This subsection lists various `packages <https://packagecontrol.io/>`_ that we
recommend you install.

cpplint
-------

https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-cpplint

Trailing Spaces
---------------

https://packagecontrol.io/packages/TrailingSpaces

User Preferences
================

To change your custom user preferences, go to "Sublime Text", "Preferences",
"Settings - User." Then add the following:

Full File Path Display
----------------------
Note that this only needs to be done on macOS since the full path appears by
default on Linux machines.

To display the current file's full path in the title bar on macOS::

    "show_full_path": true,

Show \*.sdf Files in Side Bar
-----------------------------

To show ``*.sdf`` files in the side bar::

    "file_exclude_patterns":
    [
        "*.pyc",
        "*.pyo",
        "*.exe",
        "*.dll",
        "*.obj",
        "*.o",
        "*.a",
        "*.lib",
        "*.so",
        "*.dylib",
        "*.ncb",
        "*.suo",
        "*.pdb",
        "*.idb",
        ".DS_Store",
        "*.class",
        "*.psd",
        "*.db",
        "*.sublime-workspace"
    ],

Note that the above list does not include ``*.sdf``. This is expected since by
default ``*.sdf`` does show up in the list.

Automatically Show an 80-character Ruler
----------------------------------------

To view an 80 character-wide ruler::

    "rulers": [80],

Always displaying a ruler is useful to conform to
:ref:`Drake's coding style <code-style-guide>`.
