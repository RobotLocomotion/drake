Introduction
============

This section contains design notes about (1) Drake's software implementation and
(2) mathematical derivations of algorithms implemented within Drake.

Software Design Documents
=========================

.. Create a bulleted list of links to software design documents (e.g.,
.. restructured text, PDFs, Google Docs, URLs, etc.)

- *Coming soon: Dynamics Design*
- *Coming soon: System Design*
