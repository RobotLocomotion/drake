***********************
Using Drake from Matlab
***********************

MATLAB code/bindings available in Drake are unit tested on MATLAB R2017a.
Earlier MATLAB versions may work but are not officially supported.

We are currently experimenting with a few solutions for implementing the
MATLAB bindings for Drake's new C++ libraries.  You will find minimal
examples available in master, but most are not available yet.  Stay tuned
for more information.

In the meantime,
:ref:`Using Drake from Python <python-bindings>`
may also prove useful.

Original MATLAB
===============

Prior to 2016, Drake was built around a substantial base of MATLAB software.
Most of that was removed from the head of git master during 2017.
