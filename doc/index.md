## Overview

Drake ("dragon" in Middle English) is a C++ toolbox started by the
[Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) at the MIT
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). The
[development team](/credits.html) has now grown significantly, with core
development led by the [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/). It
is a collection of tools for analyzing the dynamics of our robots and building
control systems for them, with a heavy emphasis on optimization-based
design/analysis.

While there are an increasing number of simulation tools available for
robotics, most of them function like a black box: commands go in, sensors come
out. Drake aims to simulate even very complex dynamics of robots (e.g.
including friction, contact, aerodynamics, …), but always with an emphasis on
exposing the structure in the governing equations (sparsity, analytical
gradients, polynomial structure, uncertainty quantification, …) and making this
information available for advanced planning, control, and analysis algorithms.
Drake provides an interface to Python to enable rapid-prototyping of new
algorithms, and also aims to provide solid open-source implementations for many
state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we hope Drake provides many compelling
examples that can help people get started and provide much needed benchmarks.
We are excited to accept user contributions to improve the coverage.

You can read more about the vision for Drake in this [blog
post](https://medium.com/toyotaresearch/drake-model-based-design-in-the-age-of-robotics-and-machine-learning-59938c985515).

We hope you find this tool useful. Please see
[Getting Help](/getting_help.html) if you wish to share your comments,
questions, success stories, or frustrations. And please contribute your best
bug fixes, features, and examples!

## Tutorials

Drake offers Python-based tutorials using Jupyter notebooks. We recommend that
you [view the tutorials online](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Drake-0b3b2c53-a7ad-441b-80f8-bf8350752305/project/Tutorials-2b4fc509-aef2-417d-a40d-6071dfed9199/%2Findex.ipynb).

Alternatively, to run the tutorials locally via `pip`, refer to
[drake/tutorials/README.md](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/tutorials/README.md).

## Examples

We have a number of use cases demonstrated under drake/examples in the
[source tree](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/examples),
and more available through our [Drake Gallery](/gallery.html) (contributions
welcome!).

We also have a number of [examples of using Drake as a external library](
https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-external-examples) in your own
projects, including examples with various build systems and examples of how you
might set up continuous integration.
