## Overview

Drake ("dragon" in Middle English) is a C++ toolbox started by the
[Robot Locomotion Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/locomotion/) at the MIT
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL). The
[development team](/credits.html) has now grown significantly, with core
development led by the [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/). It
is a collection of tools for analyzing the dynamics of our robots and building
control systems for them, with a heavy emphasis on optimization-based
design/analysis.

While there are an increasing number of simulation tools available for
robotics, most of them function like a black box: commands go in, sensors come
out. Drake aims to simulate even very complex dynamics of robots (e.g.
including friction, contact, aerodynamics, …), but always with an emphasis on
exposing the structure in the governing equations (sparsity, analytical
gradients, polynomial structure, uncertainty quantification, …) and making this
information available for advanced planning, control, and analysis algorithms.
Drake provides an interface to Python to enable rapid-prototyping of new
algorithms, and also aims to provide solid open-source implementations for many
state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we hope Drake provides many compelling
examples that can help people get started and provide much needed benchmarks.
We are excited to accept user contributions to improve the coverage.

We hope you find this tool useful. Please see
[Getting Help](/getting-help.html) if you wish to share your comments,
questions, success stories, or frustrations. And please contribute your best
bug fixes, features, and examples!

## Tutorials

We have Python tutorials that can be previewed and executed as Jupyter
notebooks online with no need for local installation. You can use Binder to
preview and execute the notebooks (but startup time may be long), or you can
use nbviewer to only preview the notebook (where startup time is fast):

<a target="_doc" href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RobotLocomotion/drake/nightly-release-binder?filepath=tutorials">
  <img src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg"/>
</a>
<a target="_doc" href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/nightly-release/tutorials/">
  <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/view%20on-nbviewer-brightgreen.svg"/>
</a>

If you are browsing on nbviewer, you may click on the Binder button at the
top-right of the page.

You may find more information about how to run these locally with Jupyter, the
branch the tutorials use, how they are published to Binder, etc., in
[drake/tutorials/README.md.](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/tutorials/README.md)

## Examples

We have a number of use cases demonstrated under drake/examples in the
[source tree](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/examples),
and more available through our [Drake Gallery](/gallery.html) (contributions
welcome!).

We also have a number of [examples of using Drake as a external library](
https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake-external-examples) in your own
projects, including examples with various build systems and examples of how you
might set up continuous integration.
