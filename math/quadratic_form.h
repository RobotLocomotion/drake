/** Given two quadratic forms, x'Sx > 0 and x'Px, (with P symmetric and full
 * rank), finds a change of variables x = Ty, which simultaneously diagonalizes
 * both forms (as inspired by "balanced truncation" in model-order reduction
 * [1]).  In this note, we use abs(M) to indicate the elementwise absolute
 * value.
 *
 * Adapting from [1], we observe that there is a family of coordinate systems
 * that can simultaneously diagonalize T'ST and T'PT.  Using D to denote a
 * diagonal matrix, we call the result S-normal if T'ST = I and abs(T'PT) = D⁻²,
 * call it P-normal if T'ST = D² and abs(T'PT) = I, and call it "balanced" if
 * T'ST = D and abs(T'PT) = D⁻¹. Note that if P > 0, then T'PT = D⁻¹.
 *
 * We find x=Ty such that T'ST = D and abs(T'PT) = D⁻¹, where D is diagonal. The
 * recipe is:
 * - Factorize S = LL', and choose R=L⁻¹.
 * - Take svd(RPR') = UΣV', and note that U=V for positive definite matrices,
 *     and V is U up to a sign flip of the singular vectors for all symmetric
 *     matrices.
 * - Choose T = R'U Σ^{-1/4}, where the matrix exponent can be taken elementwise
 *   because Σ is diagonal. This gives T'ST = Σ^{-1/2} (by using U'U=I), and
 *   abs(T'PT) = Σ^{1/2}.  If P > 0, then T'PT = Σ^{1/2}.
 *
 * Note that the numerical "balancing" can address the absolute scaling of the
 * quadratic forms, but not the relative scaling.  To understand this, consider
 * the scalar case: we have two quadratic functions, sx² and px², with s>0, p>0.
 * We'd like to choose x=Ty so that sT²y² and pT²y² are "balanced" (we'd like
 * them both to be close to y²).  We'll choose T=p^{-1/4}s^{-1/4}, which gives
 * sx² = sqrt(s/p)y², and px² = sqrt(p/s)y². For instance if s=1e8 and p=1e8,
 * then t=1e-4 and st^2 = pt^2 = 1.  But if s=10, p=1e7, then t=0.01, and st^2 =
 * 1e-3, pt^2 = 1e3.
 *
 * In the matrix case, the absolute scaling is important -- it ensures that the
 * two quadratic forms have the same matrix condition number and makes them as
 * close as possible to 1. Besides absolute scaling, in the matrix case the
 * balancing transform diagonalizes both quadratic forms.
