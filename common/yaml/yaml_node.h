As an implementation note for all of the below: the Node API for accessors,
modifiers, etc., is very spare compared to what we might imagine.  At, the
moment, because this is an internal class, the functions only provide the
minimal API that we need.  We can add more functions if and when we need them.

This class implements the https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#321-representation-graph

- graph cycles are not allowed;
- mapping keys must only be scalar strings.

the tag will be empty.  Use GetTag() and SetTag() to query and adjust it.
