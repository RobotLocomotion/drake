/** @file
This file contains helpers to work with Bazel-declared runfiles -- declared
data dependencies used by C++ code. The functions in this file only succeed
when used within a Bazel build.

All source code within Drake should use FindResource() or FindResourceOrThrow()
instead of these Runfiles routines, because FindResource will operate correctly
in pre-compiled / installed builds of Drake whereas FindRunfile will not.

These runfiles-related helpers are intended for use by downstream Bazel
projects that use Drake as a library, so that those projects can reuse the
relatively complicated logic within these routines during source builds.

/** (Advanced.) Returns true iff this process has Bazel runfiles available.
For both C++ and Python programs, and no matter what workspace a program
resides in (`@drake` or otherwise), this will be true when running
`bazel-bin/pkg/program` or `bazel test //pkg:program` or `bazel run
//pkg:program`. */
bool HasRunfiles();

/** (Advanced.) The return type of FindRunfile(). Exactly one of the two
strings is non-empty. */
struct RlocationOrError {
  /** The absolute path to the resource_path runfile. */

  /** The error message. */
  std::string error;
};

/** (Advanced.) Returns the absolute path to the given `resource_path` from
Bazel runfiles, or else an error message when not found. When HasRunfiles()
is false, returns an error.

@note For Drake Developers, note that in an installed copy of Drake (e.g., in a
binary release) the HasRunfiles() check will return `false`, so this function
will return an error. That means it's generally ill-advised to call this
function from library code inside Drake, or if you do you'll need to have a
fallback plan in case of an error. Typically our library code should be calling
FindResource() not FindRunfile(). On the other hand, for our private code like
unit tests and benchmarks, it's fine to call this function and in those programs
it's also fine to leave the source_repository defaulted (empty).

@param resource_path The path to find, formulated as the repository name
followed by package and filename, e.g., "repository/topdir/subdir/file.ext".
Drake resource paths look like "drake/common/foo.txt".

@param source_repository When looking up a Drake runfile, this value is ignored
(and therefore may be set to anything). Otherwise, it should be set to the value
of the preprocessor definition `BAZEL_CURRENT_REPOSITORY` or else when running
with bzlmod enabled you risk using an incorrect repo_mapping. That preprocessor
definition is Bazel magic that takes on _different values_ depending on which
translation unit is being compiled (and is undefined unless you add Bazel's
runfiles library to your own library's `deps = ...` directly), so cannot be
used as the default value here. */
