/* LateBoundFunction is a small wrapper class around a C-style raw function
pointer. (It doesn't support std::function objects.)

In a given process, the first time our Call() function is called, it will
latch-initialize the wrapped function pointer as follows:
- call the ChooseFunctor to select which function pointer to use,
- memorize that answer for next time;
- call the selected function pointer and return its result.

After the selected function pointer is memorized, future calls to Call() will
invoke it efficiently (with no conditional branching).

Note that the memorization is thread-safe, but not limited to at-most-once
semantics. Multiple threads might concurrently select and memorize the choice,
the ChooseFunctor might be called multiple times.

In support of unit testing, selections can be unlatched via HwyDynamicReset()
in "drake/common/hwy_dynamic.h".

@tparam ChooseFunctor thread-safe functor that selects the function pointer to
be wrapped. */
