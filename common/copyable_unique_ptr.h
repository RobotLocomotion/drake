/** A smart pointer with deep copy semantics.

 This is _similar_ to `std::unique_ptr` in that it does not permit shared
 ownership of the contained object. However, unlike `std::unique_ptr`,
 %copyable_unique_ptr supports copy and assignment operations, by insisting that
 the contained object be "copyable". To be copyable, the class must have either
 an accessible copy constructor, or it must have an accessible clone method
 with signature @code
   std::unique_ptr<Foo> Clone() const;
 @endcode
 where Foo is the type of the managed object. By "accessible" we mean either
 that the copy constructor or clone method is public, or
 `friend copyable_unique_ptr<Foo>;` appears in Foo's class declaration.

 <!-- Developer note: if you change or extend the definition of an acceptable
      clone method here, be sure to consider whether drake::is_cloneable should
      be changed as well. -->

 Generally, the API is modeled as closely as possible on the C++ standard
 `std::unique_ptr` API and %copyable_unique_ptr<T> is interoperable with
 `unique_ptr<T>` wherever that makes sense. However, there are some differences:

 1. It always uses a default deleter.
 2. There is no array version.
 3. To allow for future copy-on-write optimizations, there is a distinction
    between writable and const access, the get() method is modified to return
    only a const pointer, with get_mutable() added to return a writable pointer.
    Furthermore, dereferencing (operator*()) a mutable pointer will give a
    mutable reference (in so far as T is not declared const), and dereferencing
    a const pointer will give a const reference.

 This class is entirely inline and has no computational or space overhead except
 when copying is required; it contains just a single pointer and does no
 reference counting.

 __Usage__

 In the simplest use case, the instantiation type will match the type of object
 it references, e.g.:
 @code
 copyable_unique_ptr<Foo> ptr = make_unique<Foo>(...);
 @endcode
 In this case, as long `Foo` is deemed compatible, the behavior will be as
 expected, i.e., when `ptr` copies, it will contain a reference to a new
 instance of `Foo`.

 %copyable_unique_ptr can also be used with polymorphic classes -- a
 %copyable_unique_ptr, instantiated on a _base_ class, references an
 instance of a _derived_ class. When copying the object, we would want the copy
 to likewise contain an instance of the derived class.  For example:

 @code
 copyable_unique_ptr<Base> cu_ptr = make_unique<Derived>();
 copyable_unique_ptr<Base> other_cu_ptr = cu_ptr;           // Triggers a copy.
 is_dynamic_castable<Derived>(other_cu_ptr.get());          // Should be true.
 @endcode

 This works for well-designed polymorphic classes.

 @warning Ill-formed polymorphic classes can lead to fatal type slicing of the
 referenced object, such that the new copy contains an instance of `Base`
 instead of `Derived`. Some mistakes that would lead to this degenerate
 behavior:

   - The `Base` class's Clone() implementation does not invoke the `Derived`
   class's implementation of a suitable virtual method.

 <!--
 For future developers:
   - the copyability of a base class does *not* imply anything about the
   copyability of a derived class. In other words, `copyable_unique_ptr<Base>`
   can be compilable while `copyable_unique_ptr<Derived>` is not.
   - Given the pointer `copyable_unique_ptr<Base> ptr(new Derived())`, even if
   this copies "correctly" (such that the copy contains an instance of
   `Derived`), this does _not_ imply that `copyable_unique_ptr<Derived>` is
   compilable.
 -->

 @tparam T   The type of the contained object, which *must* be copyable as
             defined above. May be an abstract or concrete type.
