/* A vector of partial derivatives, optimized for use with Drake's AutoDiff.

Partials are dynamically sized, and can have size() == 0.

When adding two Partials, they must have a compatible size(). A Partials with
size() == 0 may be freely combined with any other size, and is treated as-if
it were filled with all zeros. When adding two Partials where each one has a
non-zero size, the two sizes must be identical.

Note that a Partials object with non-zero size might still be filled with zeros
for its values. Once a non-zero size() has been established, it is "sticky" and
never returns back to being zero-sized (unless the Partials is moved-from).

In particular, note that the result of a binary operation takes on the size from
either operand, e.g., foo.Add(bar) with foo.size() == 0 and bar.size() == 4 will
will result in foo.size() == 4 after the addition, and that's true even if bar's
vector was all zeros.

A large portion of this class definition appears inline, because AutoDiff is
used heavily in inner loops. The general approach is that simple word-sized
sets, gets, and branches appear inline; functions that do more than a couple
branches or touch more than a couple words (and all functions that allocate)
are out-of-line (in the cc file). */
