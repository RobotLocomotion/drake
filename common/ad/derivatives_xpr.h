The underlying type is similar to an `Eigen::Map<const Eigen::VectorXd>` which
includes all of the usual functions for element access and arithmetic.

Additionally, we provide a with_explicit_zeros() function to easily inflate
an empty vector into a vector of zeros. This is especially useful for unit
tests that need to inspect gradients.

(Advanced) To be more specific, because we need to scale up the Map by a
constant, the underlying type actually goes something like this:

    Eigen::scalar_product_op,
    const Eigen::CwiseNullaryOp<Eigen::scalar_constant_op>(coeff),
