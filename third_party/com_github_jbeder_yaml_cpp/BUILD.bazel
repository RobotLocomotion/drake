# YAML::EmitForEvents is not decorated with the YAML_CPP_API macro and so is
# hidden on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) where, due to a quilt patch, the default
# visibility is "hidden" and only declarations decorated with YAML_CPP_API have
# "default" (i.e., external) visibility.
#
# Furthermore, we need to tweak the YAML tag output so we've applied a 1-line
# patch to our vendored copy.
