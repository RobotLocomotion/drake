/// DynamicBicycleCar implements a planar rigid body bicycle model of an
/// automobile with a non-linear brush tire model from Bobier (2012) [1]. This
/// is a simplified model that assumes a vehicle that has two wheels: one at the
/// front, and one at the rear. Also, this three-DOF model captures the dynamics
/// in the lateral (Cy), longitudinal (Cx), and yaw (about Cz) directions but
/// not the roll (about Cx) and pitch (about Cy) directions.
///
/// There are three coordinate frames of interest in this model: a local frame L
/// fixed on earth with origin Lo, a frame attached to the vehicle's chassis C
/// with the origin of C being Co located at a distance of Lf from the front
/// axle along the center line of the vehicle, and a steering frame D with the
/// origin Do located at the front axle along the center line of the vehicle.
/// Note that the point Co is also referred to as the control point Cp, and
/// although the location of the vehicle's center of mass Ccm can move depending
/// on weight transfer dynamics, it is assumed that the location of Ccm is
/// coincident with Co and Ccp. L is a cartesian, right handed coordinate system
/// with Lz being gravity aligned (gravity acts in the negative Lz direction).
///
/// The states of the model are:
///
/// - Lx measure of the location of Cp from Lo `p_LoCp_x` [m]
/// - Ly measure of the location of Cp from Lo `p_LoCp_y` [m]
/// - Yaw angle from Lx to Cx with positive Lz sense `yaw_LC` [rad]
/// - Cx measure of Cp's velocity in L `v_LCp_x` [m/s]
/// - Cy measure of Cp's velocity in L `v_LCp_y` [m/s]
/// - C's angular velocity in frame L `yawDt_LC` [rad/s]
///
/// Inputs to this system:
///
/// - Steer angle from Cx to Dx with positive Cz sense `steer_CD` [rad]
/// - The Cx measure of the Longitudinal force on body C at Cp `f_Cp_x` [N]
///
/// Outputs of this system:
///
/// - A DynamicBicycleCarState containing the 6-dimensional state vector of
///   the vehicle.
///
/// Note that the vehicle's angular velocity in L `yawDt_LC` is sometimes
/// referred to as the yaw rate `r`, and the tire angle is sometimes referred
/// to as δ.
