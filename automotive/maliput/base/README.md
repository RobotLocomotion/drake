# Introduction

This folder contains concrete implementations of some abstract Maliput API
classes located within the maliput/api/ directory. It's named "base" because
the concrete classes located within this directory will serve as a baseline for
more concrete implementations. At the time of writing this, we're unsure whether
the concrete classes within this folder will evolve into more featureful
implementations, or if they will serve as parent classes. We did not name it
"simple" because whether the existing concrete implementations within this
folder are "simple" is subjective. Plus, we're unsure whether more complex or
simpler implementations will eventually exist in the future.
