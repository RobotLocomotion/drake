TrafficLights:
# The traffic light IDs denote the intersection entrance they regulate. For
# example, the "SouthFacing" traffic light is responsible for signaling
# vehicles that enter the intersection from the south (meaning the vehicles are
# facing north). In this intersection, a single traffic light is used for all
# vehicles at a particular entrance regardless of whether they are traveling
# straight through, making a left turn, or making a right turn while in the
# intersection.
#
# Most 2x2 intersections use bulb groups containing only three round bulbs: red,
# yellow, and green. To demonstrate the use of arrows, however, a yellow
# left-arrow bulb is included. It is positioned left of the green round bulb.
# The ASCII art diagram below shows the bulb configuration within a bulb group.
# It also shows the traffic light's frame when you are looking at the traffic
# light (the bulbs are facing you, the +X-axis is pointing out of the screen):
#
#                +Z
#                 ^
#                 |
#                 |
#              -------
#              |     |      Legend:
#              | (R) |        - (R): Round red bulb
#              |     |        - (Y): Round yellow bulb
#              -------        - (G): Round green bulb
#              |     |        - <Y-: Left arrow yellow bulb
#    <---------| (Y) |-----------------------------------------> +Y
#              |     |
#        -------------
#        |     |     |
#        | <Y- | (G) |
#        |     |     |
#        -------------
#                 |
#                 |
#                 V
#
# Notice that the X and Y axes of the traffic light's frame is chosen to be in
# the middle of the vertical stack of three bulbs. This is because the yellow
# left-arrow is optional. The intersection *could* be signalized without it. It
# simply tells left-turning vehicles to employ extra caution.
#
# The Z-offset of the traffic light's frame within the world frame is computed
# as follows. The goal is for the bottom edge of the traffic light to be about
# 18' above the ground. A typical traffic light is about 45" tall since each of
# the three bulbs is 14" tall plus 1.5" gaps between them. Thus, the traffic
# light's Z-offset above the road surface is 18 * 12 + (45 / 2) = 238.5"
# (6.0579 m). Assuming the road surface is at the world frame's Z = 0, the
# Z-component of the traffic light's pose within the world frame is also
# 6.0579 m.
#
# Since each traffic light only has one bulb group in this intersection, there
# is zero lateral and rotational offset between the traffic light's frame and
# the bulb group's frame.
#
# Within the bulb group frame, the positions of the bulbs are as follows:
#
#  - Round red light: This bulb is at the top of the stack, so it has a
#    position of x = 0 m, y = 0 m, and z = 45" / 2 - 14" / 2 = 15.5" (0.3937 m).
#
#  - Round yellow light: This bulb is in the middle of the stack, so it has a
#    position of x = 0 m, y = 0 m, and z = 0 m.
#
#  - Round green light: This bulb is in the bottom of the stack and is thus
#    opposite of the round red light. It has a position of x = 0, y = 0,
#    z = -0.3937 m.
#
#  - Yellow left-arrow: This bulb is to the left of the green round bulb. A 1.5"
#    gap separates the two bulbs. Thus it has a position of x = 0 m,
#    y = -14" - 1.5" = -15.5" (-0.3937 m), and z = -0.3937 m.
#
# The rotations of the bulb frames are all zero since the entire traffic light
# and its bulb group is already oriented such that their x-axes are pointing
# towards the intersection entrance to which they apply).
#
# The bounding boxes are omitted because the default values as defined by
# drake::maliput::api::rules::Bulb are sufficient.
