# We build IPOPT by shelling out to autotools.

# We run autotools in a genrule, and only files explicitly identified as outputs
# of that genrule can be made available to other rules. Therefore, we need a
# list of every file in the IPOPT install.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/281.

# find include/coin -name "*.h" -o -name "*.hpp" -o -name "*.hdd" | sort |
