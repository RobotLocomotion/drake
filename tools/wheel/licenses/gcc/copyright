This file describes the licenses which apply to the GNU compiler collection,
portions of which are redistributed with Drake. The contents of this file are
based on the Debian package, which provides a much more comprehensive listing
than is available on the AlmaLinux platform used to build Drake wheels. Despite
the differing origins, it is believed that the information in this file is
substantially accurate.

Debian packaging is done by the Debian GCC Maintainers
<debian-gcc@lists.debian.org>, with sources obtained from:

  ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/  (for full releases)
  svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/           (for prereleases)
  ftp://sourceware.org/pub/newlib/     (for newlib)
  git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gm2.git   (for Modula-2)

The current gcc-11 source package is taken from the SVN gcc-11-branch.

Changes: See changelog.Debian.gz

Debian splits the GNU Compiler Collection into packages for each language,
library, and documentation as follows:

Language       Compiler package  Library package    Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ada            gnat-11          libgnat-11          gnat-11-doc
BRIG           gccbrig-11       libhsail-rt0
C              gcc-11                              gcc-11-doc
C++            g++-11           libstdc++6         libstdc++6-11-doc
D              gdc-11
Fortran 95     gfortran-11      libgfortran5       gfortran-11-doc
Go             gccgo-11         libgo0
Objective C    gobjc-11         libobjc4
Objective C++  gobjc++-11
Modula-2       gm2-11           libgm2

For some language run-time libraries, Debian provides source files,
development files, debugging symbols and libraries containing position-
independent code in separate packages:

Language  Sources      Development   Debugging            Position-Independent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++                                  libstdc++6-11-dbg  libstdc++6-11-pic
D         libphobos-11-dev

Additional packages include:

All languages:
libgcc1, libgcc2, libgcc4       GCC intrinsics (platform-dependent)
gcc-11-base                    Base files common to all compilers
gcc-11-soft-float              Software floating point (ARM only)
gcc-11-source                  The sources with patches

Ada:
libgnat-util11-dev, libgnat-util11   GNAT version library

C:
cpp-11, cpp-11-doc            GNU C Preprocessor
libssp0-dev, libssp0            GCC stack smashing protection library
libquadmath0                    Math routines for the __float128 type
fixincludes                     Fix non-ANSI header files

C, C++ and Fortran 95:
libgomp1-dev, libgomp1		GCC OpenMP (GOMP) support library
libitm1-dev, libitm1		GNU Transactional Memory Library

Biarch support: On some 64-bit platforms which can also run 32-bit code,
Debian provides additional packages containing 32-bit versions of some
libraries.  These packages have names beginning with 'lib32' instead of
'lib', for example lib32stdc++6.  Similarly, on some 32-bit platforms which
can also run 64-bit code, Debian provides additional packages with names
beginning with 'lib64' instead of 'lib'.  These packages contain 64-bit
versions of the libraries.  (At this time, not all platforms and not all
libraries support biarch.)  The license terms for these lib32 or lib64
packages are identical to the ones for the lib packages.

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

Version 3.1, 31 March 2009

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.

When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.

0. Definitions.

A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
on the Runtime Library.

"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
subsequent versions published by the FSF.

"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
the license of GCC.

"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.

The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
preprocessors.

A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
Eligible Compilation Process.

1. Grant of Additional Permission.

You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.

2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.

The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
requirements of the license of GCC.

The newlib subdirectory is a collection of software from several sources.
Each file may have its own copyright/license that is embedded in the source
file.

This list documents those licenses which are more restrictive than
a BSD-like license or require the copyright notice
to be duplicated in documentation and/or other materials associated with
the distribution.  Certain licenses documented here only apply to
specific targets.  Certain clauses only apply if you are building the
code as part of your binary.

Note that this list may omit certain licenses that
only pertain to the copying/modifying of the individual source code.
If you are distributing the source code, then you do not need to
worry about these omitted licenses, so long as you do not modify the
copyright information already in place.
