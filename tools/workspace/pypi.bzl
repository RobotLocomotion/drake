    Example:
        Download and use the "foo" package, version 1.2.3, hosted on PyPI at

    Arguments:
        name: A unique name for this rule. This argument will be used for the
            package name if the "package" argument is omitted [Name; required].

        package: The name of the PyPI package to download. The "name" argument
            will be used if this argument is omitted [String; optional].

        version: The version of the PyPI package to be downloaded
            [String; required].

        build_file: The file to use as the BUILD file for this repository.
            This argument is a label relative to the WORKSPACE
            [String; required].

        sha256: The expected SHA-256 hash of the archive to download. This
            argument must match the SHA-256 hash of the downloaded archive.
            The download will fail if omitted, but the checksum-mismatch error
            message will offer a suggestion for the correct value of this
            argument [String; required].

        strip_prefix: A directory prefix to strip from the extracted files
            [String; optional].

        mirrors: A dict from string to list-of-string with key "pypi", where
            the list-of-strings are URLs to use, formatted using {package},
            {version}, and {p} (where {p} is the first letter of {package}).
