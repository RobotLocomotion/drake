[clarabel] Opt-out of Rust linking for BLAS/LAPACK

The blas_src and lapack_src crates are the Rust ecosystem's solution
for inversion of control when linking the BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
Library code refers to those crates and then the top-level Cargo file
of the ultimate application binary turns on a feature flag of those
crates that adds the right lines to the linker (and can also rebuild
BLAS and LAPACK from source, if necessary).

However, since Drake's ultimate "application" is to ship our own
shared library, we must not allow Rust to govern which libraries to
link. Thus, we need to delete the lines that perform the linking.

Reasoning for not upstreaming this patch: Drake-specific option.
