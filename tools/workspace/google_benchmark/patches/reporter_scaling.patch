Add an environment variable that suppresses the scaling warning

When running under our benchmark_tool.py, we pin the benchmark to a
specific cpu and set only that one cpu to performance mode. However,
googlebench doesn't realize that it's cpu-pinned so it checks that
*all* cores are in performance mode, and emits this spurious warning
because most cores are still in power-save mode. The benchmark_tool.py
uses this variable to suppress the false message.
