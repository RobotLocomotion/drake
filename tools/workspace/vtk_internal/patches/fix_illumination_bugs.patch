Shadows and shadows with PBR materials have problems. This attempts to address
them.

1. The PBR illumination model didn't account for *non*-positional lights. It
   would always compute the direction to the light from fragment to light
   *position*. But non-positional lights don't have a position to speak of.
   Instead, it should simply be the negative of the light direction; that is the
   definition of the direction to the light source for directional lights.
2. The fragment shader has text search-and-replace games in two locations:
   vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper and vtkShadowMapPass. The former introduces the
   lighting calculations to define "radiance", the latter updates the "radiance"
   definition to account for shadows. This update depends on the shadow map
   pass knowing what strings the data mapper uses. In this case, the strings
   that vtkShadowMapPass was expecting didn't cover all of the strings produced
   by vtkOpenGLPolyDataMapper. The latter has been updated.
3. VTK Uses exponential shadow maps (ESM). That algorithm has a particular tuning
   constant. Ideally, the constant would be infinity (so that the approximation
   of a step function is perfect). Finite numerical precision makes that
   impossible. However, it should be as large a number as possible before
   numerical precision issues kick in. The authors of ESM recommend 80; VTK
   used 11 (leading to bizarre shadow behaviors where shadows were being
   strongly attenuated based on increased distance from the light).
4. vtkShadowMapBakerPass does one rendering pass for each light to create a
   shadow map. Indirectly, this causes the light transform for each light to
   change, based on the camera associated with the light currently being
   rendered. For a light defined in the camera space, this would corrupt its
   transform matrix. When it comes time to render the shadow for that light,
   we'd have the wrong transform and we'd produce the wrong camera pose. Now,
   the shadow map baker caches the initial light transforms and resets the
   light's transform before creating its corresponding camera.

These changes should be upstreamed to VTK.
