# When developing within Drake, we don't want //tools:drake_visualizer to
# depend on the entire pydrake library, because that adds a dependency on a
# whole bunch of C++ code that is irrelevant for the visualizer.  So, here we
# provide a small stub version of pydrake with only getDrakePath implemented
# (the only piece drake_visualizer needs).  Note that the installed version of
# drake-visualizer *does* use the installed (full) version of pydrake -- this
# is development-sandbox-only stub.
