    """A macro to be called in the WORKSPACE that adds an external from GitHub
    using a workspace rule.

    Args:
        name: required name is the rule name and so is used for @name//...
            labels when referring to this archive from BUILD files.
        repository: required GitHub repository name in the form
            organization/project.
        commit: required commit is the tag name or git commit sha to download.
        commit_pin: optional boolean, set to True iff the archive should remain
            at the same version indefinitely, eschewing automated upgrades to
            newer versions.
        sha256: required sha256 is the expected SHA-256 checksum of the
            downloaded archive. When unsure, you can omit this argument (or
            comment it out) and then the checksum-mismatch error message will
            offer a suggestion.
        build_file: optional build file is the BUILD file label to use for
            building this external. As a Drake-specific abbreviation, when
            provided as a relative label (e.g., ":package.BUILD.bazel"), it
            will be taken as relative to the "@drake//tools/workspace/{name}/"
            package. When no build_file is provided, the BUILD file(s) within
            the archive will be used.
        patches: optional list of patches to apply, matching what's described
            at https://bazel.build/rules/lib/repo/git#git_repository-patches.
            As a Drake-specific abbreviation, when provided using relative
            labels (e.g., ":patches/foo.patch"), they will be taken as relative
            to the "@drake//tools/workspace/{name}/" package.
        extra_strip_prefix: optional path to strip from the downloaded archive,
            e.g., "src" to root the repository at "./src/" instead of "./".
        local_repository_override: optional local repository override can be
            used for temporary local testing; instead of retrieving the code
            from GitHub, the code is retrieved from the local filesystem path
            given in the argument.
        mirrors: required mirrors is a dict from string to list-of-string with
            key "github", where the list-of-strings are URLs to use, formatted
            using {repository} and {commit} string substitutions. The
            mirrors.bzl file in this directory provides a reasonable default
            value.
        upgrade_advice: optional string that describes extra steps that should
            be taken when upgrading to a new version.
            Used by //tools/workspace:new_release.
