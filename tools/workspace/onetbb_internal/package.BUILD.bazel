# Here we use the header files from oneAPI but the runtime shared library from
# @mosek//:tbb.  We use the MOSEKâ„¢ copy of TBB because that's what we've always
# been using, because it's the version that MOSEK was built & tested against,
# and because re-compiling TBB from source with Bazel is probably not a lot of
# fun (i.e., not worth the effort).
