# This constant contains Drake's default lists of mirrors.  It is keyed by the
# repository type using magic strings ("github", etc.), and has values of type
# list-of-string; each string is a pattern for a mirror URL.
#
# When calling a Drake workspace rule that requires a mirror= argument, this
# constant is a reasonable default value.
#
# Each repository type has its own keyword string substitutions within its
# pattern string; these will vary from one repository type to another; consult
# the specific rules (e.g., github_archive()) for details.
#
# The first item in each list is the authoritative source (e.g., the upstream
# server), if there is one.
#
# For Drake's defaults, Packages are mirrored from upstream (GitHub, Bitbucket,
# PyPI, etc.) to CloudFront backed by an S3 bucket.
