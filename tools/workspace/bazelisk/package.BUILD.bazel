# The @bazelisk external is in a unique situation. Because we must run bazelisk
# to bootstrap everything else we need, we must keep a vendored copy of it in
# drake/third_party/com_github_bazelbuild_bazelisk/. The workspace external
# only serves as a reference point so that Drake's third-party dependency
# mirroring and automatic upgrades will also cover bazelisk. We use a lint test
# to flag when the workspace external differs from the vendored copy, whereupon
# we print out Drake maintainer instructions explaining how to sync the copy.
