Through special arrangement with the authors, Drake binary releases incorporate
a pre-compiled version of SNOPT[1] as part of the Mathematical Program toolbox.
Thanks to Philip E. Gill and Elizabeth Wong for their kind support.

Drake users who would like to compile Drake from source with SNOPT will need to
purchase their own SNOPT source license from the website above.
