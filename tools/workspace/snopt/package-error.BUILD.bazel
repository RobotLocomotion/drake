# This stub BUILD file for SNOPT contains the same public targets as the real
# BUILD file, always reports an error (from error.txt) during compilation, but
# does not report any loading-phase errors.  This is useful to defer error
# reporting until after the loading phase, so that `bazel query` commands will
# still work even with SNOPT missing.
