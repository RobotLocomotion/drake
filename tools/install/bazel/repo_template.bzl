Declares the @drake repository based on an installed Drake binary image.

This enables downstream BUILD files to refer to Drake targets such as
@drake//bindings/pydrake even when using precompiled Drake releases.

Only a limited number of targets are supported, currently only:
- @drake//bindings/pydrake
