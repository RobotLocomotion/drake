# rcfile is loaded), we enable -Werror by default for Drake's *own* targets,

#
# Developers may still disable errors locally by passing --copt=-w on the
# command line, or promote *any* warnings even from externals to errors via
# --copt=-Werror.

# When compiilng Drake as an external package, this rcfile is not loaded and we
# won't promote warnings to errors by default.
