If you have improvements to Drake, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).  Please make sure you look at our Developer's page for information on code style, etc, and be prepared to engage in active code review on your pull request.

We would also like to hear about your success stories if you've used Drake in your own projects.  Please consider contributing to our [gallery](http://drake002.csail.mit.edu/drake/gallery.html) by editing gallery.html in the drake/doc/ directory and submitting a pull request.

Important note: Drake is an open source project licensed under extremely flexible terms intended to encourage use by anyone, for any purpose. When you make a contribution to the Drake project, you are agreeing to do so under those same terms. The details are below; if you aren't comfortable with those terms, we're still friends but you shouldn't contribute.
