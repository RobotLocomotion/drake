/** Interface for collision checkers to use.

 <!-- TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI): This documentation focuses on the context management
  aspect of this class. We need to extend the documentation to give a broader
  overview of the class. The goal is to give sufficient context that they'd know
  what kind of nail this is a hammer for and how to swing it. Topics include,
  but are not limited to:

    - Emphasis that everything is characterized w.r.t. *robot* bodies.
      Distinguish the terms "full model" (robot and environment), "robot" or
      "robot model", and "environment bodies".
    - Performing collision queries
      - individual configurations
      - "edges"
      - Clearance
    - Padding
    - Collision filtering
    - Adding additional collision geometries.
    - Clear guidance on the minimal acts that constitute correct usage. E.g.,
      do I have to call `AllocateContexts()`? When should I not? etc.
    - Clear delineation of serial queries that can be performed in parallel and
      queries that themselves parallelize and guidance on not mixing them.

  It's also important to partition the guidance between "user" documentation and
  "implementer" documentation.
  -->

 This interface builds on the basic multi-threading idiom of Drake: one context
 per thread. It offers two models to achieve multi-threaded parallel collision
 checking:

 - using thread pools (e.g. OpenMP or similar) and "implicit contexts" managed
   by this object
 - using arbitrary threads and "explicit contexts" created by this object

 @anchor ccb_implicit_contexts
 <h5>Implicit Context Parallelism</h5>

 Many methods of this class aren't designed for entry from arbitrary threads
 (e.g. from std::async threads), but rather are designed for use with a main
 thread and various thread-pool-parallel operations achieved by using
 directives like `omp parallel`. To support this usage, the base class
 `AllocateContexts()` protected method establishes a pool of contexts to support
 the implicit context parallelism specified in the constructor. (Note: if the
 collision checker declares that parallel checking is not supported, only one
 implict context will be allocated). `AllocateContexts()` must be called and
 only be called as part of the constructor of a derived class defined as final.

 Once the context pool is created, clients can access a thread-associated
 context by using `model_context(optional<int> context_number)` and related
 methods. These methods may be called in two ways:

 - without a context number, the association between thread and context uses the
   OpenMP notion of thread number
 - with a context number, the method uses the context corresponding to the
   provided number

 Without a context number, these context access methods are only safe under the
 following conditions:

 - the caller is the "main thread"
 - the caller is an OpenMP team thread *during execution of a parallel region*

 With a context number, these context access methods are only safe under the
 following conditions:

 - no two or more threads simultaneously use the same context number

 Methods supporting implicit context parallelism are noted below by having a
 reference to this section; as a rule of thumb, any public method that takes a
 `context_number` argument uses implicit context parallelism.

 Users of this class (derived classes and others) can write their own parallel
 operations using implicit contexts, provided they limit parallel blocks to only
 use `const` methods or methods marked to support implicit contexts parallelism,
 and the parallel operations are:

 - without a context number, only with parallelism using OpenMP directives
 - with a context number, via a parallelization method that provides a notion of
   thread numbers similar in behavior to OpenMP's (i.e. a thread number in
   [0, number of threads), not arbitrary values like
   `std::this_thread::get_id()`)

 To determine the greatest implicit context parallelism that can be achieved in
 a parallelized operation, `GetNumberOfThreads(Parallelism parallelize)`
 returns the lesser of the provided `parallelism` and the supported implicit
 context parallelism.

 <!-- TODO(calderpg-tri, rick-poyner) Add parallel for-loop examples once
      drakelint supports OpenMP pragmas in docs.  -->

 @anchor ccb_explicit_contexts
 <h5>Explicit Context Parallelism</h5>

 It is also possible to use arbitrary thread models to perform collision
 checking in parallel using explicitly created contexts from this class.
 Contexts returned from MakeStandaloneModelContext() may be used in any thread,
 using only `const` methods of this class, or "explicit context" methods.

 Explicit contexts are tracked by this class using `std::weak_ptr` to track
 their lifetimes. This mechanism is used by
 PerformOperationAgainstAllModelContexts to map an operation over all collision
 contexts, whether explicit or implicit.

 Methods supporting explicit context parallelism are noted below by having a
 reference to this section; as a rule of thumb, any public method that takes a
 `model_context` first argument uses explicit context parallelism.

 In practice, multi-threaded collision checking with explicit contexts may look
 something like the example below.

 @code
 const Eigen::VectorXd start_q ...
 const Eigen::VectorXd sample_q1 ...
 const Eigen::VectorXd sample_q2 ...

 const auto check_edge_to = [&collision_checker, &start_q] (
     const Eigen::VectorXd& sample_q,
     CollisionCheckerContext* explicit_context) {
   return collision_checker.CheckContextEdgeCollisionFree(
       explicit_context, start_q, sample_q);
 };

 const auto context_1 = collision_checker.MakeStandaloneModelContext();
 const auto context_2 = collision_checker.MakeStandaloneModelContext();

 auto future_q1 = std::async(std::launch::async, check_edge_to, sample_q1,
                             context_1.get());
 auto future_q2 = std::async(std::launch::async, check_edge_to, sample_q2,
                             context_2.get());

 const double edge_1_valid = future_q1.get();
 const double edge_2_valid = future_q2.get();
 @endcode

 <h5>Mixing Threading Models</h5>

 It is possible to support mixed threading models, i.e., using both OpenMP
 thread pools and arbitrary threads. In this case, each arbitrary thread (say,
 from std::async) should have its own instance of a collision checker made using
 Clone(). Then each arbitrary thread will have its own implicit context pool.

 <h5>Implementing Derived Classes</h5>

 Collision checkers deriving from CollisionChecker *must* support parallel
 operations from both of the above parallelism models. This is generally
 accomplished by placing all mutable state within the per-thread context. If
 this cannot be accomplished, the shared mutable state must be accessed in a
 thread-safe manner. There are APIs that depend on SupportsParallelChecking()
 (e.g., CheckConfigsCollisionFree(), CheckEdgeCollisionFreeParallel(),
 CheckEdgesCollisionFree(), etc); a derived implementation should return `false`
 from SupportsParallelChecking() if there is no meaningful benefit to attempting
 to do work in parallel (e.g., they must fully serialize on shared state).

  /** @name Adding geometries to a body

   While the underlying model will have some set of geometries to represent
   each body, it can be useful to extend the representative set of geometries.
   These APIs admit adding and removing such geometries to the underlying model.
   We'll distinguish the geometries added by the checker from those in the
   underlying model by referring to them as "checker" geometries and "model"
   geometries, respectively.

   For example, when an end effector has successfully grasped a manipuland,
   we can add additional geometry to the end effector body, representing the
   extent of the manipuland, causing the motion planning to likewise consider
   collisions with the manipuland. Note, this implicitly treats the manipuland
   as being rigidly affixed to the end effector.

   Checker geometries are managed in groups, identified by "group names". Each
   group can contain one or more checker geometries. This is particularly useful
   when multiple geometries should be added and removed as a whole. Simply by
   storing the shared group name, all checker geometries in the group can be
   removed with a single invocation, relying on the collision checker to do
   the book keeping for you.

   Note that different collision checker implementations may limit the set of
   supported Shape types; e.g. sphere-robot-model collision checkers only add
   sphere shapes to robot bodies, and voxel-based collision checkers cannot add
   individual collision geometries to the environment at all. Therefore, all
   methods for adding collision geometries report if the geometries were added.
   The derived classes should clearly document which shapes they support. */

  /** @name Padding the distance between bodies

   Ultimately, the model's bodies are represented with geometries. The distance
   between bodies is the distance between their representative geometries.
   However, the exact distance between those geometries is not necessarily
   helpful in planning. For example,

     - You may want to add padding when real-world objects differ from the
       planning geometry.
     - In some cases, limited penetration is expected, and possibly desirable,
       such as when grasping in clutter.

   Padding is a mechanism where these distances can be "fudged" without
   modifying the underlying model. The *reported* distance between two bodies
   can be decreased by adding *positive* padding or increased by adding
   *negative* padding. One could think of it as padding the geometries -- making
   the objects larger (positive) or smaller (negative). This isn't quite true.
   Padding is defined for *pairs* of geometries.

   Ultimately, the padding data is stored in an NxN matrix (where the underlying
   model has N total bodies). The matrix is symmetric and the entry at (i, j) --
   and (j, i) -- is the padding value to be applied to distance measurements
   between bodies i and j. It is meaningless to apply padding between a
   body and itself. Furthermore, as %CollisionChecker is concerned with the
   state of the *robot*, it is equally meaningless to apply padding between
   *environment* bodies. To avoid the illusion of padding, those entries on
   the diagonal and corresponding to environment body pairs are kept at zero.

   <u>Configuring padding</u>

   <!-- TODO(sean.curtis): We have a function for setting the padding between
    one robot body and *all* environment bodies, but not between a robot body
    and all *other* robot bodies. This apparent hole is only due to the
    judgement that it wouldn't be helpful. If we have a use case that would
    benefit, we can add it. -->

   Padding can be applied at different levels of scope:

     - For all pairs, via SetPaddingMatrix().
     - For all (robot, environment) or (robot, robot) pairs via
       SetPaddingAllRobotEnvironmentPairs() and SetPaddingAllRobotRobotPairs().
     - For all (robot i, environment) pairs via
       SetPaddingOneRobotBodyAllEnvironmentPairs().
     - For pair (body i, body j) via SetPaddingBetween().

   Invocations of these methods make immediate changes to the underlying padding
   data. Changing the order of invocations will change the final padding state.
   In other words, setting padding for a particular pair (A, B) followed by
   calling, for example, SetPaddingOneRobotBodyAllEnvironmentPairs(A) could
   erase the effect of the first invocation.

   @anchor collision_checker_padding_prereqs
   <u>Configuration prerequisites</u>

   In all these configuration methods, there are some specific requirements:

     - The padding value must always be finite.
     - Body indices must be in range (i.e., in [0, N) for a model with N
       total bodies).
     - If the parameters include one or more more body indices, at least one of
       them must reference a robot body.

   <u>Introspection</u>

   The current state of collision padding can be introspected via a number of
   methods:

     - View the underlying NxN padding matrix via GetPaddingMatrix().
     - Find out if padding values are heterogeneous via
       MaybeGetUniformRobotEnvironmentPadding() and
       MaybeGetUniformRobotRobotPadding().
     - Query the specific padding value between a pair of bodies via
       GetPaddingBetween().
     - Find out the maximum padding value via GetLargestPadding().

  /** @name Collision filtering

   The %CollisionChecker adapts the idea of "collision filtering" to *bodies*
   (see geometry::CollisionFilterManager). In addition to whatever
   collision filters have been declared within the underlying model,
   %CollisionChecker provides mechanisms to layer *additional* filters by
   specifying a pair of bodies as being "filtered". No collisions or
   distance measurements are reported on filtered body pairs.

   The "filter" state of all possible body pairs are stored in a symmetric NxN
   integer-valued matrix, where N is the number of bodies reported by the
   plant owned by this collision checker.

   The matrix can only contain one of three values: 0, 1, and -1. For the
   (i, j) entry in the matrix, each value would be interpreted as follows:

     0: The collision is *not* filtered. Collision checker will report
        collisions and clearance between bodies I and J.
     1: The collision *is* filtered. Collision checker will *not* report
        collisions and clearance between bodies I and J.
    -1: The collision *is* filtered *by definition*. Collision checker will
        *not* report collisions and clearance between bodies I and J and
        the user cannot change this state.

   CollisionChecker limits itself to characterizing the state of the *robot*.
   As such, it *always* filters collisions between pairs of environment
   bodies. It also filters collisions between a body and itself as nonsensical.
   Therefore, the matrix will always have immutable -1s along the diagonal and
   for every cell representing an environment-environment pair.

   The collision filter matrix must remain *consistent*. Only valid values
   for body pairs are accepted. I.e., assigning an (environment, environment)
   pair a value of 0 or 1 is "inconsistent". Likewise doing the same on the
   diagonal. Alternatively, assigning a -1 to any pair with a robot body
   would be inconsistent. The functions for configuring collision filters
   will throw if explicitly asked to make an inconsistent change.

   The %CollisionChecker's definition of filtered body pairs is initially
   drawn from the underlying model's configuration (see
   GetNominalFilteredCollisionMatrix()). However, the CollisionChecker's
   definition of the set of collision filters is independent of the model after
   construction and can be freely modified to allow for greater freedom
   in determining which bodies can affect each other. */

  /** @name Edge collision checking

   These functions serve motion planning methods, such as sampling-based
   planners and shortcut smoothers, which are concerned about checking that an
   "edge" between two configurations, q1 and q2, is free of collision.

   These functions *approximately* answer the question: is the edge collision
   free. The answer is determined by sampling configurations along the edge
   and reporting the edge to be collision free if all samples are collision
   free. Otherwise, we report the fraction of samples (starting with the start
   configuration) that reported to be collision free. The tested samples include
   the start and end configurations, q1 and q2, respectively.

   %CollisionChecker doesn't know how an edge is defined. An edge can be
   anything from a simple line segment (e.g. a linear path in C-space) to an
   arbitrarily complex path (e.g. a Reeds-Shepp path). The shape of the edge is
   defined implicitly by the ConfigurationInterpolationFunction as an
   interpolation between two configurations `q1` and `q2` (see
   SetConfigurationDistanceFunction() and
   SetConfigurationInterpolationFunction()).

   %CollisionChecker picks configuration samples along an edge by uniformly
   sampling the interpolation *parameter* from zero to one. (By definition, the
   interpolation at zero is equal to `q1` and at one is equal to `q2`.) The
   number of samples is determined by the distance between `q1` and `q2`, as
   provided by a ConfigurationDistanceFunction, divided by "edge step size"
   (see set_edge_step_size()).

   As a result, the selection of interpolation function, distance function, and
   edge step size must be coordinated to ensure that edge collision checking is
   sufficiently accurate for your application.

   <u>Default functions</u>

   The configuration distance function is defined at construction (from
   CollisionCheckerParams). It can be as simple as `|q1 - q2|` or could be
   a weighted norm `|wᵀ⋅(q1 − q2)|` based on joint importance or unit
   reconciliation (e.g., some qs are translational and some are rotational).
   Because of this, the "distance" reported may have arbitrary units.

   Whatever the units are, the edge step size must match. The step size value
   and distance function will determine the number of samples on the edge. The
   smaller the step size, the more samples (and the more expensive the collision
   check becomes).

   If all joints are revolute joints, one reasonable distance function is the
   weighted function `|wᵀ⋅(q1 − q2)|` where the weights are based on joint
   speed. For joint dofs `J = [J₀, J₁, ...]` with corresponding positive maximum
   speeds `[s₀, s₁, ...]`, we identify the speed of the fastest joint
   `sₘₐₓ = maxᵢ(sᵢ)` and define the per-dof weights as `wᵢ = sₘₐₓ / sᵢ`.
   Intuitively, the more time a particular joint requires to cover an angular
   distance, the more significance we attribute to that distance -- it's a
   _time_-biased weighting function. The weights are unitless so the reported
   distance is in radians. For some common arms (IIWA, Panda, UR, Jaco, etc.),
   we have found that an edge step size of 0.05 radians produces reasonable
   results.

   %CollisionChecker has a default interpolation function, as defined by
   MakeDefaultConfigurationInterpolationFunction(). It performs Slerp for
   quaternion-valued dofs and linear interpolation for all other dofs. Note that
   this is not appropriate for all robots, (e.g. those using a BallRpyJoint, or
   any non-holonomic robot). You will need to provide your own interpolation
   function in such cases.

   @anchor collision_checker_parallel_edge
   <u>Function-level parallelism</u>

   Parallelization in some edge collision checks is provided using OpenMP and is
   enabled when both: (1) the collision checker declares that parallelization is
   supported (i.e. when SupportsParallelChecking() is true) and (2) when
   multiple OpenMP threads are available for execution.

   Due to this internal parallelism, special care must be paid when calling
   these methods from any thread that is not the main thread; ensure that, for a
   given collision checker instance, implicit context methods are only called
   from one non-OpenMP thread at a given time.

   <u>Thoughts on configuring %CollisionChecker for edge collision
       detection</u>

   Because the edge collision check samples the edge, there is a perpetual
   trade off between the cost of evaluating the edge and the likelihood that
   a real collision is missed. In practice, the %CollisionChecker should be
   configured to maximize performance for a reasonable level of collision
   detection reliability. There is no definitive method for tuning the
   parameters. Rather than advocating a tuning strategy, we'll simply elaborate
   on the available parameters and leave the actual tuning as an exercise for
   the reader.

   There are two properties that will most directly contribute to the accuracy
   of the edge tests: edge step size and padding. Ultimately, any obstacle in
   _C-space_ whose measure is smaller than the edge step size is likely to be
   missed. The goal is to tune the parameters such that such features -- located
   in an area of interest (i.e., where you want your robot to operate) -- will
   have a low probability of being missed.

   Edge step size is very much a global parameter. It will increase the cost of
   _every_ collision check. If you are unable to anticipate where the small
   features are, a small edge step size will be robust to that uncertainty. As
   such, it serves as a good backstop. It comes at a cost of increasing the cost
   of *every* test, even for large geometries with nothing but coarse features.

   Increasing the padding can likewise reduce the likelihood of missing
   features. Adding padding has the effect of increasing the size of the
   workspace obstacles in C-space. The primary benefit is that it can be applied
   locally. If there is a particular obstacle with fine features that your robot
   will be near, padding between robot and that obstacle can be added so that
   interactions between robot and obstacle are more likely to be caught. Doing
   so leaves the global cost low for coarse features. However, padding comes at
   the cost that physically free edges may no longer be considered free.

   The best tuning will likely include configuring both edge step size and
   applying appropriate padding. */
