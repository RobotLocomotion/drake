/**
GcsTrajectoryOptimization implements a simplified motion planning optimization
problem introduced in the paper ["Motion Planning around Obstacles with Convex
Optimization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04422) by Tobia Marcucci, Mark
Petersen, David von Wrangel, Russ Tedrake.

Instead of using the full time-scaling curve, this problem uses a single
time-scaling variable for each region. This formulation yields continuous
trajectories, which are not differentiable at the transition times between the
regions since non-convex continuity constraints are not supported yet. However,
it supports continuity on the path r(s) for arbitrary degree. The path
r(s) can be reconstructed from the gcs solution q(t) with
`NormalizeSegmentTimes()` and post-processed with e.g. Toppra to enforce
acceleration bounds.

The ith piece of the composite trajectory is defined as q(t) = r((t - tᵢ) /
hᵢ). r : [0, 1] → ℝⁿ is a the path, parametrized as a Bézier curve with order
n. tᵢ and hᵢ are the initial time and duration of the ith sub-trajectory.

This class supports the notion of a Subgraph of regions. This has proven useful
to facilitate multi-modal motion planning such as: Subgraph A: find a
collision-free trajectory for the robot to a grasping posture, Subgraph B: find
a collision-free trajectory for the robot with the object in its hand to a
placing posture, etc.
