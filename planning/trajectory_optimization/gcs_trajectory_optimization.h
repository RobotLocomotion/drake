/**
GcsTrajectoryOptimization implements a simplified motion planning optimization
problem introduced in the paper "Motion Planning around Obstacles with Convex
Optimization."

"Motion Planning around Obstacles with Convex Optimization" by Tobia Marcucci,
Mark Petersen, David von Wrangel, Russ Tedrake. https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04422

Instead of using the full time-scaling curve, this problem uses a single
time-scaling variable for each region. This formulation yields continuous
trajectories, which are not differentiable at the transition times between the
regions since non-convex continuity constraints are not supported yet. However,
it supports continuity on the path for arbitrary degree. The resulting
trajectories can be post-processed with e.g. Toppra in order to smooth out the
timing rescaling.

The ith piece of the composite trajectory is defined as q(t) = r((t - tᵢ) /
hᵢ). r : [0, 1] → ℝⁿ is a the path, parametrized as a Bézier curve with order
n. tᵢ and hᵢ are the initial time and duration of the ith sub-trajectory.

This class supports the notion of a Subgraph of regions. This has proven useful
to facilitate multi-modal motion planning such as: Subgraph A: find a
collision-free trajectory for the robot to a grasping posture, Subgraph B: find
a collision-free trajectory for the robot with the object in its hand to a
placing posture, etc.
