/**
GcsTrajectoryOptimization implements a simplified motion planning optimization
problem introduced in the paper ["Motion Planning around Obstacles with Convex
Optimization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04422) by Tobia Marcucci, Mark
Petersen, David von Wrangel, Russ Tedrake.

@experimental

Instead of using the full time-scaling curve, this problem uses a single
time-scaling variable for each region. This formulation yields continuous
trajectories, which are not differentiable at the transition times between the
regions since non-convex continuity constraints are not supported yet. However,
it supports continuity on the path r(s) for arbitrary degree. The path
r(s) can be reconstructed from the gcs solution q(t) with
`NormalizeSegmentTimes()` and post-processed with e.g. Toppra to enforce
acceleration bounds.

The ith piece of the composite trajectory is defined as q(t) = r((t - tᵢ) /
hᵢ). r : [0, 1] → ℝⁿ is a the path, parametrized as a Bézier curve with order
n. tᵢ and hᵢ are the initial time and duration of the ith sub-trajectory.

This class supports the notion of a Subgraph of regions. This has proven useful
to facilitate multi-modal motion planning such as: Subgraph A: find a
collision-free trajectory for the robot to a grasping posture, Subgraph B: find
a collision-free trajectory for the robot with the object in its hand to a
placing posture, etc.

@anchor continuous_revolute_joints
### Continuous Revolute Joints

This class also supports robots with continuous revolute joints (revolute joints
that don't have any joint limits) and mobile bases. Adding or subtracting 2π to
such a joint's angle leaves it unchanged; this logic is implemented behind the
scenes. To use it, one should specify the joint indices that don't have limits,
and ensure all sets satisfy the "convexity radius" property -- their width along
a dimension corresponding to a continuous revolute joint must be less than π.
This can be enforced when constructing the convex sets, or after the fact with
`geometry::optimization::PartitionConvexSet`. The `GcsTrajectoryOptimization`
methods `AddRegions` and `AddEdges` will handle all of the intersection checks
behind the scenes, including applying the appropriate logic to connect sets that
"wrap around" 2π.

  Subspace is optional. Only edges that connect through the subspace will be

  require constraints that are not yet supported by the GraphOfConvexSets::Edge
  constraint, e.g., set containment of a Hyperellipsoid is formulated via

  @param edge_offsets is an optional list of vectors. If defined, the list must
  contain the same number of entries as `edges_between_regions`, and the order
  must match. In other words, if defined, there must be one edge offset for each
  specified edge, and they must be at the same index. For each pair of sets

  between sets that "wrap around" 2π along some dimension, due to, e.g., a
  continuous revolute joint. This edge offset corresponds to the translation
