for pair index k, a contiguous span of (position-coordinate index j, λ(j, p))
entries over J(p), the coordinates that change the pair's relative pose. λ has
units of meters of worst-case point displacement of the pair's distal side per
unit change of coordinate j, valid for every configuration in the
trajectory's global control-point box.

Each pair also carries a scalar `carveout_slack(p)`, the residual motion of
the coordinates the constant-coordinate carve-out (trajectory normalization; the
joint-support scope) removed from J(p). "Constant" there is a *tolerance* — a
coordinate whose global control-box range is at most
Options::continuity_tolerance — not an identity, so a carved coordinate may
still displace the pair's distal side by up to λ̃_j · range_j. That residual is
charged unconditionally inside MotionBound(), which is what makes Δ_p a true
upper bound on the pair's relative motion over the whole trajectory rather than
one that ignores the carved coordinates. It is exactly zero — bit for bit —
whenever every carved coordinate is *exactly* constant, which is the case for
