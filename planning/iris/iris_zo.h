This algorithm constructs probabilistically collision-free polytopes in robot
configuration space while only relying on a collision checker. The sets are
constructed using a simple parallel zero-order optimization strategy. The
produced polytope P is probabilistically collision-free in the sense that one
gets to control the probability δ that the fraction of the volume-in-collision
is larger than ε

Pr[λ(P\Cfree)/λ(P) > ε] ⋞ δ.

@param starting_ellipsoid provides the initial ellipsoid around which to grow
the region. This is typically a small ball around a collision-free
configuration (e.g. Hyperellipsoid::MakeHyperSphere(radius, seed_point)). The
center of this ellipsoid is required to be collision-free.
@param domain describes the total region of interest; computed IRIS regions will
be inside this domain. It must be bounded, and is typically a simple bounding
box representing joint limits (e.g. from HPolyhedron::MakeBox).
@param options contains algorithm parameters such as the desired collision-free
fraction, confidence level, and various algorithmic settings.

The @p starting_ellipsoid and @p domain must describe elements in the same
ambient dimension as the configuration space of the robot, unless a
parameterization is specified (in which case, they must match
`options.parameterization_dimension`).
@return A HPolyhedron representing the computed collision-free region in
configuration space.
@ingroup robot_planning
@experimental

@throws if the center of `starting_ellipsoid` is in collision, or violates any
of the user-specified constraints in `options.prog_with_additional_constraints`.

@note This can be a long running function that needs to solve many QPs. If you
have a solver which requires a license, consider acquiring the license before
solving this function. See AcquireLicense for more details.
