 * Graphs" In 2024 IEEE Internation Conference on Robotics and Automation.

 *
 * @param checker The collision checker containing the plant and its associated
 * scene_graph.
 * @param generator There are points in the algorithm requiring randomness. The
 * generator controls this source of randomness.
 * @param sets [in/out] initial sets covering the space (potentially empty).
 * The cover is written into this vector.
 * @param max_clique_solver The max clique solver used. If parallelism is set to
 * allow more than 1 thread, then this class **must** be implemented in C++. If
 * nullptr is passed as the `max_clique_solver`, then max clique will be solved
 * using an instance of MaxCliqueSolverViaMip with a conservative limit set on
 * the number of branch and bound nodes explored. This default solver will in
 * general use suboptimal cliques when constructing the greedy clique cover, but
 * is faster than solving the max clique problem to global optimality.
 *
 * Currently, the padding in the collision checker is not forwarded to the
 * algorithm, and therefore the final regions do not necessarily respect this
 * padding. Effectively, this means that the regions are generated as if the
 * padding is set to 0. This behavior may be adjusted in the future at the
 * resolution of #18830.
 *
 * Note that this method requires an implementation of a MaxCliqueSolverBase
 * which must be implemented in C++. The only solver of this kind implemented by
 * Drake is MaxCliqueSolverViaMip which requires the availability of a
 * Mixed-Integer Linear Programming solver (e.g. Gurobi and/or Mosek). We
 * recommend enabling those solvers if possible
 * (https://drake.mit.edu/bazel.html#proprietary_solvers). The method will throw
 * if MaxCliqueSolverViaMip cannot solve the max clique problem. @see
 * MaxCliqueSolverViaMip.
