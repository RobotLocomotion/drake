originally taken from https://github.com/nalt/wsg50-ros-pkg, SHA 56376f0. The

Since obtaining the model files from the above-mentioned source, they were
substantially modified for use by Drake. For example, the original .stl mesh
files were converted to .obj files. Our changes are covered by Drake's license
terms (see LICENSE.TXT in Drake's root folder).

The files in sdf/ were developed entirely in Drake, and are also
covered by Drake's license terms.
