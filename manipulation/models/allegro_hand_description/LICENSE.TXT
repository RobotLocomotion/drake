This folder contains a model of the Allegro hand. The files were originally
taken from
https://github.com/felixduvallet/allegro-hand-ros/tree/master/allegro_hand_description,SHA c414ffb.
The original license for these files is BSD, expressed in
http://wiki.ros.org/allegro_hand_ros

Since obtaining the model files from the above-mentioned source, they were
substantially modified for use by Drake. For example, the original STL mesh
files were converted to OBJ files, and various inertia properties, motor
damping and motor effort values were modified. Our changes are covered by
Drake's license terms (see LICENSE.TXT in Drake's root folder).
