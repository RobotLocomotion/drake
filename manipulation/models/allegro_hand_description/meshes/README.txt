The OBJ files in this folder were converted from STL using the Open Asset
Import Library (through http://www.greentoken.de/onlineconv/) and then
subsequently tweaked; simply reconverting from source will not reproduce these
exact files. The input STL files came from the manufacturer (https://github.com
simlabrobotics/allegro_hand_ros/tree/master/allegro_hand_description/meshes).
The names of the meshes (including the .0 substrings) mirror the original
files as closely as possible to facilitate future mapping between STL and OBJ
files.
