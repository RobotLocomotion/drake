Since obtaining the model files from the above-mentioned source, they were
substantially modified for use by Drake. For example, the original STL mesh
files were converted to OBJ files, and various mass / inertia properties and
collision models were modified. Our changes are covered by Drake's license terms
(see LICENSE.TXT in Drake's root folder).
