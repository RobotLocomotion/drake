# TRI HomeCart

The HomeCart is a bimanual manipulation station developed at the Toyota
Research Institute (TRI).  The model files contained here are all developed by TRI
and distributed under Drake's license.  They represent a slightly simplified
version of the model files used internally at TRI (most notably they are using
a simplified version of the grippers).
