This folder contains models of the 6-dof and 7-dof 3-finger Kinova
Jaco arms.  The files were originally taken from the Kinova ROS
package, which is available at:
https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros/tree/kinova-ros-beta/
kinova_description/urdf, SHA 006c2e1.

The original license for these files is covered under the BSD license terms,
as stated in the upstream package file:
https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros/blob/kinova-ros-beta/kinova_description/package.xml

Since obtaining the model files from the above source, they were modified for
use by Drake. For example, the original DAE and STL mesh files were converted
to OBJ files, and various collision models were modified. Color values in the
URDF were taken directly from the diffuse values in the .dae files contributed
upstream in https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros/pull/222. Our changes
are covered by Drake's license terms (see LICENSE.TXT in Drake's root folder).
