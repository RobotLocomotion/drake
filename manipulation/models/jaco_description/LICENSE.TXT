This folder contains a model of the 6-dof 3-finger Kinova Jaco arm.
The file was originally taken from the Kinova ROS package, which is
available at:
https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-ros/tree/kinova-ros-beta/
kinova_description/urdf, SHA 006c2e1.

The original license for these files is covered under the BSD license terms,
as stated in the package.xml file:

kinova_description/package.xml

Since obtaining the model files from the above source, they were modified for
use by Drake. For example, the original DAE and STL mesh files were converted
to OBJ files, and various collision models were modified. Our changes are 
covered by Drake's license terms (see LICENSE.TXT in Drake's root folder).
