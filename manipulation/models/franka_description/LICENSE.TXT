This folder contains a model of the Franka Emika Panda arm.

This model was originally taken from the Franka ROS package, which is
available at:
https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros/tree/kinetic-devel/franka_description
SHA d7cd447344.

The license for these files is the Apache 2.0 license
https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros/blob/kinetic-devel/LICENSE
(also see package.xml).

The inertial properties for the arm/hand were copied from
https://github.com/mkrizmancic/franka_gazebo which also uses the
Apache 2.0 license.

As a result, `package.xml` and `urdf/*.urdf` are covered by the Apache
2.0 license.  The remaining files (README, unit test, BUILD, etc.) are
covered by Drake's license terms (see LICENSE.TXT in Drake's root
folder)
