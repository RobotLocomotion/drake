/// Iiwa controller and controller plant setup
///
/// This class implements the software stack of the Iiwa arm and the LCM-to-FRI
/// adapter installed in it.  The only control mode FRI exposes is
/// position-control with an optional feedforward torque command.  Torque
/// control mode, however, is not available.  The arm receives position commands
/// (`lcmt_iiwa_command`) and emits status (`lcmt_iiwa_status`); the Iiwa
/// controller built here takes care of translating the command into torques on
/// the Iiwa joints and the Iiwa measured positions and torques into those
/// status messages.  Note that only 7 DoF Iiwa arm is supported.
///
/// In order to do this, the controller maintains an entire separate Iiwa
/// plant (*not* the simulated plant!) to perform inverse dynamics
/// computations.  These computations correspond to the servoing and gravity
/// compensation done on the real Iiwa; disagreement between the controller
/// model and the simulated model represents errors in the servo, end-effector,
/// and gravity-compensation configuration.
