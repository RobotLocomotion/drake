/**
 * Given a RigidBodyTree containing a given scene, the RandomClutterGenerator
 * can repeatedly generate bounded random poses/configurations on selected
 * model instances within the tree. Each of these objects are separated from
 * each other by (settable) minimum distance and their object frames are
 * located within a (settable) bounding box volume. This class solves the
 * IK problem to find feasible poses on the clutter bodies
 *
 * NOTES:
 * 1. Current version only ensures bounded clutter for the case of all model
 * instances on the tree containing the QuaternionFloatingJoint.
 * 2. The current version has only been tested with SNOPT.
 * 3. The solvability of the problem is strongly dependent on the dimensions
 * of the clutter bounding volume as specified in clutter_size and the number
 * and geometry of the clutter model instances that are to be dealt with. There
 * is no explicit time-out on the execution and the GenerateFloatingClutter
 * will keep attempting to find a solution, if any.
 * 4. There are no explicit guarantees on the solvability.
 * 5. The underlying IK computations utilize the bullet collision library and
 * as such only process the convex-hull of the geometry. The resulting IK
 * solution will be subject to this simplification.
