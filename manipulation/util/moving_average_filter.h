 *       = 1/k ∑ⱼ x[j] ∀ j = 0..k otherwise;

 * to be filtered, y is the filtered signal and k is the index of latest
 * element in the signal time-series.

 * Note that this class is meant to serve as a standalone simple utility and
 * a filter of this form in a more `drake::systems` flavour can be generated
 * from a `systems::AffineSystem` since this is a LTI filter.
