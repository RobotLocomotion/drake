### ([@liangfok][], [#1953][]) - Replacement of valuecheckMatrix() with CompareMatrices()

Method `valuecheckMatrix()` in `drake/util/testUtil.h` was removed and replaced with `drake::util::CompareMatrices()` in `drake/util/eigen_matrix_compare.h`.

Unit tests that originally contained

    valuecheckMatrix(matrix1, matrix2, tolerance);

should be modified to use Google Test and the following line:

    EXPECT_TRUE(drake::util::CompareMatrices(matrix1, matrix2, tolerance, MatrixCompareType::absolute));
