Introduction
------------
Drake is undergoing continuous development and cannot yet offer a stable, documented API or ABI. To help downstream users cope, this document provides brief summaries of the changes. The changes are organized by pull requests that are merged into Drake's master branch.

Descriptions of Pull Requests
------------------------------

### ([@jamiesnape][], [#1961][]]) - Wiki Documentation Update

Updated the way `cpplint` and `Sphinx` are installed on Ubuntu Linux.

### ([@liangfok][], [#1960][]) - Nonfunctional Code Style Refinements

Removed some trailing spaces and extraneous blank lines in LCM messages.

### ([@liangfok][], [#1959][]) - Wiki Documentation Update

Refined the code style and code style tools pages on Drake's wiki. No code changes.

### ([@david-german-tri][], [#1955][]) - API Change for Code Style Conformance

Renames `RigidBody::CollisionElement::collidesWith()` to be `RigidBody::CollisionElement::CollidesWith()`. Updates the collision model unit test to use Google Test.

### ([@jwnimmer-tri][], [#1954][]) - Enable `cpplint` readability/Braces

Numerous non-functional modifications necessary due to the CPPLint readability/braces rule being enabled.

### ([@liangfok][], [#1953][]) - Replacement of valuecheckMatrix() with CompareMatrices()

Method `valuecheckMatrix()` in `drake/util/testUtil.h` was removed and replaced with `drake::util::CompareMatrices()` in `drake/util/eigen_matrix_compare.h`.

Unit tests that originally contained

    valuecheckMatrix(matrix1, matrix2, tolerance);

should be modified to use Google Test and the following line:

    EXPECT_TRUE(drake::util::CompareMatrices(matrix1, matrix2, tolerance, MatrixCompareType::absolute));
