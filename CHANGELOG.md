Descriptions of Pull Requests
------------------------------

### ([@jwnimmer-tri][], [#1966][]) - Renamed `eiquadprog.hpp` to be `eiquadprog.h`.

Renamed `eiquadprog.hpp` to `eiquadprog.h`.

### ([@david-german-tri][], [#1955][]) - Renamed `collidesWith()` to be `CollidesWith()`.

Renames `RigidBody::CollisionElement::collidesWith()` to be `RigidBody::CollisionElement::CollidesWith()`. Updates the collision model unit test to use Google Test.

### ([@liangfok][], [#1953][]) - Renamed of `valuecheckMatrix()` to be `CompareMatrices()`

Method `valuecheckMatrix()` in `drake/util/testUtil.h` was removed and replaced with `drake::util::CompareMatrices()` in `drake/util/eigen_matrix_compare.h`.

Unit tests that originally contained

    valuecheckMatrix(matrix1, matrix2, tolerance);

should be modified to use Google Test and the following line:

    EXPECT_TRUE(drake::util::CompareMatrices(matrix1, matrix2, tolerance, MatrixCompareType::absolute));
