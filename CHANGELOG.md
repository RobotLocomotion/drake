Descriptions of Pull Requests
------------------------------


### ([@liangfok][], [#1985][]) - Added Max Delay and Warn command line options to quadrotor's unit test

Changed the command line options of the quad rotor's unit test. Users can now specify via the command line the maximum real-time delay and whether to throw an exception or print an error if this maximum delay is exceeded.

### ([@jwnimmer-tri][], [#1966][]) - Renamed `eiquadprog.hpp` to be `eiquadprog.h`.

Renamed `eiquadprog.hpp` to `eiquadprog.h`.

### ([@david-german-tri][], [#1955][]) - Renamed `collidesWith()` to be `CollidesWith()`.

Renames `RigidBody::CollisionElement::collidesWith()` to be `RigidBody::CollisionElement::CollidesWith()`. Updates the collision model unit test to use Google Test.

### ([@liangfok][], [#1953][]) - Renamed of `valuecheckMatrix()` to be `CompareMatrices()`

Method `valuecheckMatrix()` in `drake/util/testUtil.h` was removed and replaced with `drake::util::CompareMatrices()` in `drake/util/eigen_matrix_compare.h`.

Unit tests that originally contained

    valuecheckMatrix(matrix1, matrix2, tolerance);

should be modified to use Google Test and the following line:

    EXPECT_TRUE(drake::util::CompareMatrices(matrix1, matrix2, tolerance, MatrixCompareType::absolute));
