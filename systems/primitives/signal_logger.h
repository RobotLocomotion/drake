/// A discrete sink block which logs its input to memory (not thread safe). This
/// data is then retrievable (e.g. after a simulation) via a handful of accessor
/// methods. This system holds a large, mutable Eigen matrix for data storage,
/// where each column corresponds to a data point. It saves a data point and
/// the context time whenever it samples its input.
///
/// By default, sampling is performed every time the Simulator completes a
/// trajectory-advancing substep (that is, via a per-step Publish event), with
/// the first sample occurring during Simulator::Initialize(). That means the
/// samples will generally be unevenly spaced in time. If you prefer regular
/// sampling, you may optionally specify a "publish period" in which case
/// sampling occurs periodically, with the first sample occurring at time 0.
/// Alternatively (not common), you can specify that logging should only occur
/// at "forced publish" events, meaning at explicit calls to System::Publish().
/// The Simulator's "publish every time step" option also results in forced
/// publish events, so should be disabled if you want to control logging
/// yourself.
///
/// @warning %SignalLogger is _not_ thread-safe because it writes to a mutable
/// buffer internally. If you have a Diagram that contains a SignalLogger,
/// even with each thread having its own Context, the threads will conflict.
/// You would have to have separate Diagrams in each thread to avoid trouble.
