/**
 * A first-order, semi-explicit Euler integrator. State is updated in the
 * following manner: <pre>
 *     v(t₀+h) = v(t₀) + dv/dt(t₀) * h
 *       dq/dt = N(q(t₀)) * v(t₀+h)
 *     q(t₀+h) = q(t₀) + dq/dt * h
 * </pre>
 * where `v` are the generalized velocity variables and `q` are generalized
 * coordinates. `h` is the integration step size, and `N` is a matrix 
 * (dependent upon `q(t₀)`) that maps velocities to time derivatives of 
 * generalized coordinates. For rigid body systems in 2D, for example, `N`
 * will generally be an identity matrix. For a single rigid body in 3D, `N` and
 * its pseudo-inverse (`N` is generally non-square but always left invertible)
 * are frequently used to transform between time derivatives of Euler 
 * parameters (unit quaternions) and angular velocities (and vice versa), 
 * [Nikravesh 1988].
 * 
 * Note that these equations imply that the velocity variables are updated
 * first and that these new velocities are then used to update the generalized
 * coordinates (compare to ExplicitEulerIntegrator, where the generalized
 * coordinates are updated using the previous velocity variables).
 *
 * When a mechanical system is Hamiltonian (informally meaning that the
 * system is not subject to velocity-dependent forces), the semi-explicit
 * Euler integrator is a symplectic (energy conserving) integrator.
 * Symplectic integrators advertise energetically consistent behavior with large
 * step sizes compared to non-symplectic integrators. Multi-body systems
 * are not Hamiltonian, even in the absence of externally applied
 * velocity-dependent forces, due to the presence of both Coriolis and
 * gyroscopic forces. This integrator thus does not generally conserve energy
 * for such systems.
 *
 * <h4>Association between time stepping and the semi-explicit Euler
 * integrator:</h4>
 * Though many time stepping approaches use the formulations above, these
 * equations do not represent a "time stepping scheme". The semi-explicit
 * Euler integration equations can be applied from one point in state space to 
 * another, assuming smoothness in between, just like any other integrator using
 * the following process: 
 * (1) a simulator integrates to discontinuities, (2) the state of the ODE/DAE 
 * is re-initialized, and (3) integration continues.
 *
 * In contrast, time stepping schemes enforce all constraints at a single
 * time in the integration process: though a billiard break may consist of tens
 * of collisions occurring sequentially over a millisecond of time, a time
 * stepping method will treat all of these collisions as occurring
 * simultaneously.
