///
/// To allow for update rectification (i.e. drop and replacement), in case it
/// fails to meet certain criteria (e.g. not within tolerances), construction
/// can be deferred to a consolidation step. In between consolidations, updates
/// can be rolled back (i.e. discarded) one by one on a last-input-first-output
/// basis. Implementations are thus encouraged to keep recent updates in a light
/// weight form, deferring heavier computations and construction of a better
/// suited representation for evaluation. As such, evaluation is bound to
/// succeed only after consolidation.
