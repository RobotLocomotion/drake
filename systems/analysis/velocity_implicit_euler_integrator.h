/**
 * A first-order, fully implicit integrator optimized for second-order systems,
 * with a second-order error estimate.
 *
 * The velocity-implicit Euler integrator is a variant of the first-order
 * implicit Euler that takes advantage of the simple mapping q̇ = N(q) v
 * of second order systems to formulate a smaller problem in velocities (and
 * miscellaneous states if any) only. For systems with second-order dynamics,
 * %VelocityImplicitEulerIntegrator formulates a problem that is half as large
 * as that formulated by Drake's ImplicitEulerIntegrator, resulting in improved
 * run-time performance. Upon convergence of the resulting system of equations,
 * this method provides the same discretization as ImplicitEulerIntegrator, but
 * at a fraction of the computational cost.
 *
 * This integrator requires a system of ordinary differential equations in
 * state `x = (q,v,z)` to be expressible in the following form:
 *
 *     q̇ = N(q) v;                            (1)
 *     ẏ = f_y(t,q,y),                        (2)
 * where `q̇` and `v` are linearly related via the kinematic mapping `N(q)`,
 * `y = (v,z)`, and `f_y` is a function that can depend on the time and state.
 *
 * Implicit Euler uses the following update rule at time step n:
 *
 *     qⁿ⁺¹ = qⁿ + h N(qⁿ⁺¹) vⁿ⁺¹;            (3)
 *     yⁿ⁺¹ = yⁿ + h f_y(tⁿ⁺¹,qⁿ⁺¹,yⁿ⁺¹).     (4)
 *
 * To solve the nonlinear system for `(qⁿ⁺¹,yⁿ⁺¹)`, the velocity-implicit Euler
 * integrator iterates with a modified Newton's method: At iteration `k`, it
 * finds a `(qₖ₊₁,yₖ₊₁)` that attempts to satisfy
 *
 *     qₖ₊₁ = qⁿ + h N(qₖ) vₖ₊₁.              (5)
 *     yₖ₊₁ = yⁿ + h f_y(tⁿ⁺¹,qₖ₊₁,yₖ₊₁);     (6)
 *
 * In this notation, the `n`'s index timesteps, while the `k`'s index the
 * specific Newton-Raphson iterations within each time step.
 *
 * Notice that we've intentionally lagged N(qₖ) one iteration behind in Eq (5).
 * This allows it to substitute (5) into (6) to obtain a non-linear system in
 * `y` only. Contrast this strategy with the one implemented by
 * ImplicitEulerIntegrator, which solves a larger non-linear system in the full
 * state x.
 *
 * To find a `(qₖ₊₁,yₖ₊₁)` that approximately satisfies (5-6), we linearize
 * the system (5-6) to compute a Newton step. Define
 *
 *     l(y) = f_y(tⁿ⁺¹,qⁿ + h N(qₖ) v,y),     (7)
 *     Jₗ(y) = ∂l(y) / ∂y.                    (8)
 *
 * To advance the Newton step, the velocity-implicit Euler integrator solves
 * the following linear equation for `Δy`:
 *
 *     (I - h Jₗ) Δy = - R(yₖ),               (9)
 * where `R(y) = y - yⁿ - h l(y)` and `Δy = yₖ₊₁ - yₖ`. The `Δy` solution
 * directly gives us `yₖ₊₁`. It then substitutes the `vₖ₊₁` component of `yₖ₊₁`
 * in (5) to get `qₖ₊₁`.
 *
 * This implementation uses a Newton method and relies upon the obvious
 * convergence to a solution for `y` in `R(y) = 0` where
 * `R(y) = y - yⁿ - h l(y)` as `h` becomes sufficiently small.
 * General implementational details were gleaned from [Hairer, 1996].
 *
 * ### Error Estimation
 *
 * In this integrator, we simultaneously take a large step at the requested
 * step size of h as well as two half-sized steps each with step size h/2.
 * The result from two half-sized steps is propagated as the solution, while
 * the difference between the two results is used as the error estimate for the
 * propagated solution. This error estimate is accurate to the second order.
 *
 * To be precise, let x̅ⁿ⁺¹ be the computed solution from a large step, x̃ⁿ⁺¹
 * be the computed solution from two small steps, and xⁿ⁺¹ be the true
 * solution. Since the integrator propagates x̃ⁿ⁺¹ as its solution, we denote
 * the true error vector as ε = x̃ⁿ⁺¹ - xⁿ⁺¹. VelocityImplicitEulerIntegrator
 * uses ε' = x̅ⁿ⁺¹ - x̃ⁿ⁺¹, the difference between the two solutions, as the
 * second-order error estimate, because for a smooth system, ‖ε'‖ = O(h²), and
 * ‖ε - ε'‖ = O(h³). See the notes in
 * VelocityImplicitEulerIntegrator<T>::get_error_estimate_order() for a
 * detailed derivation of the error estimate's truncation error.
 *
 * @note In the statistics reported by IntegratorBase, all statistics that deal
 * with the number of steps or the step sizes will track the large full-sized
 * steps. Furthermore, because the small half-sized steps are propagated as the
 * solution, the large full-sized step is the error estimator, and the error
 * estimation statistics track the effort during the large full-sized step.
 * Depending on the system, when the integrator is not in full-Newton mode, the
 * statistics may be counterintuitive and difficult to compare against other
 * integrators, because the large error-estimation step is performed first,
 * followed by the two small propagated steps, implying that most of the work in
 * constructing and factorizing matrices and failed Newton-Raphson iterations
 * are performed during the large steps and counted toward the error estimation
 * statistics

   * Returns the asymptotic order of the difference between the large and small
   * steps (from which the error estimate is computed), which is 2. The error
   * estimate is accurate to within O(h³) of the true error.
   * 
   * ### Derivation of the asymptotic order
   *
   * To derive the second-order error estimate, let us first define the vector-
   * valued function `e(tⁿ, h, xⁿ) = x̅ⁿ⁺¹ - xⁿ⁺¹`, the truncation error for a
   * single, full-sized velocity-implicit Euler integration step, with initial
   * conditions `(tⁿ, xⁿ)`, and a step size of `h`.
   * Furthermore, use `∇f` to denote the Jacobian df/dx.
   *
   * Let us use `x*` to denote the true solution after a half-step, `x(tⁿ+½h)`,
   * and `x̃*` to denote the velocity-implicit Euler solution after a single
   * half-sized step. Furthermore, let us use `xⁿ*¹` to denote the true solution
   * of the system at time `t = tⁿ+h` if the system were at `x̃*` when
   * `t = tⁿ+½h`. See the following diagram for an illustration.
   *
   *      Legend:
   *      ───── propagation along the true system

   *      State :----------------------- x̅ⁿ⁺¹  <─── error estimator
   *            :
   *            :

   *            :            :·········· x̃ⁿ⁺¹  <─── propagated result
   *            :            :

   *            :
   *            xⁿ ───────  x*   ─────── xⁿ⁺¹  <─── true solution
   *
   * Furthermore, we will use superscripts to denote evaluating an expression
   * with x at that subscript and t at the corresponding time, e.g. `ẍⁿ`
   * denotes `ẍ(tⁿ, xⁿ) = ∂f/∂tⁿ + ∇fⁿ fⁿ`, and `f*` denotes `f(tⁿ+½h, x*)`.
   * 
   * Let us look at a single velocity-implicit Euler step. Upon Newton-Raphson
   * convergence, the truncation error for velocity-implicit Euler, which is the
   * same as the truncation error for implicit Euler (because both methods solve
   * Eqs. (3-4)), is
   *
   *     e(tⁿ, tⁿ+h, xⁿ) = ½ h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).       (10)
   *
   * After one small half-sized step, the
   * solution `x̃*` is
   *
   *     x̃* = x* + e(tⁿ, tⁿ+½h, xⁿ)
   *        = x* + (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³),
   *     x̃* - x* = (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).         (11)
   *
   *  Taylor
   * expanding about `t = tⁿ+½h` in this alternate reality,
   *
   *     xⁿ*¹ = x̃* + ½h f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) + O(h²).               (12)
   *
   * Similarly, Taylor expansions give us
   *
   *     xⁿ⁺¹ = x* + ½h f* + O(h²),               (13)
   *     f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) = f* + (∇f*) (x̃* - x*)
   *                   = f* + O(h²),              (14)
   * where in the last line we substituted Eq. (11).
   *
   * Eq. (12) minus Eq. (13) gives us,
   *
   *     xⁿ*¹ - xⁿ⁺¹ = x̃* - x* + ½h(f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) - f*) + O(h³),
   *                 = x̃* - x* + O(h³),
   * where we just substituted in Eq. (14). Finally, substituting in Eq. (11),
   *
   *     xⁿ*¹ - xⁿ⁺¹ = (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).       (15)
   *
   * After the second small step, the solution `x̃ⁿ⁺¹` is
   *
   *     x̃ⁿ⁺¹ = xⁿ*¹ + e(tⁿ+½h, tⁿ+h, x̃*)
   *          = xⁿ*¹ + (1/8) h² ẍ(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) + O(h³).       (16)
   *
   * Taking Taylor expansions,
   *
   *     x* = xⁿ + ½h fⁿ + O(h²) = xⁿ + O(h).                (17)
   *     x̃* - xⁿ = (x̃* - x*) + (x* - xⁿ) = O(h),         (18)
   * where we substituted in Eqs. (11) and (17),
   *
   *     ∂f/∂t(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) = ∂f/∂tⁿ + ½h ∂²f/∂t²ⁿ + ∇∂f/∂tⁿ (x̃* - xⁿ) + O(h²)
   *                      = ∂f/∂tⁿ + O(h),                   (19)
   * where we substituted in Eq. (18), and
   *
   *     ∇f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) = ∇fⁿ + ½h (∂/∂t)∇f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) + ∇²fⁿ (x̃* - xⁿ) +
   *                     O(h²)
   *                   = ∇fⁿ + O(h),                         (20)
   *     f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*)  = fⁿ + ½h ∂f/∂tⁿ + ∇fⁿ (x̃* - xⁿ)
   *                   = fⁿ + O(h),                          (21)
   * therefore,
   *
   *     ẍ(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) = ∂f/∂t(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) + ∇f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*)
   *                  = ∂f/∂tⁿ + ∇fⁿ fⁿ + O(h) = ẍⁿ + O(h)   (22)
   *
   * Substituting (22) into (16),
   *
   *     x̃ⁿ⁺¹ = xⁿ*¹ + (1/8) h² ẍⁿ + O(h³)
   *          = xⁿ⁺¹ + (1/4) h² ẍⁿ + O(h³),
   * therefore
   *
   *     ε = x̃ⁿ⁺¹ - xⁿ⁺¹ = (1/4) h² ẍⁿ + O(h³).  (23)
   *
   * Subtracting Eq. (23) from Eq. (10),
   *
   *     e(tⁿ, tⁿ+h, xⁿ) - ε = (½ - 1/4) h² ẍⁿ + O(h³),
   *     (x̅ⁿ⁺¹ - xⁿ⁺¹) - (x̃ⁿ⁺¹ - xⁿ⁺¹) = (1/4) h² ẍⁿ + O(h³).
   *
   * Since the first term on the RHS matches `ε` (Eq. (23)) and the LHS
   * matches `ε'`,
   *
   *     ε' = ε + O(h³).                                     (24)
