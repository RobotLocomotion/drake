/**
 * A first-order, fully implicit integrator with second order error estimation.
 *
 * This integrator uses the following update rule:<pre>
 * x(t+h) = x(t) + h f(t+h,x(t+h))
 * </pre>
 * where x are the state variables, h is the integration step size, and
 * f() returns the time derivatives of the state variables. Contrast this
 * update rule to that of an explicit first-order integrator:<pre>
 * x(t+h) = x(t) + h f(t, x(t))
 * </pre>
 * Thus implicit first-order integration must solve a nonlinear system of
 * equations to determine *both* the state at t+h and the time derivatives
 * of that state at that time. Cast as a nonlinear system of equations,
 * we seek the solution to:<pre>
 * x(t+h) − x(t) − h f(t+h,x(t+h)) = 0
 * </pre>
 * given unknowns x(t+h).
 *
 * This "implicit Euler" method is known to be L-Stable, meaning both that
 * applying it at a fixed integration step to the  "test" equation `y(t) = eᵏᵗ`
 * yields zero (for `k < 0` and `t → ∞`) *and* that it is also A-Stable.
 * A-Stability, in turn, means that the method can integrate the linear constant
 * coefficient system `dx/dt = Ax` at any step size without the solution
 * becoming unstable (growing without bound). The practical effect of
 * L-Stability is that the integrator tends to be stable for any given step size
 * on an arbitrary system of ordinary differential equations. See
 * [Lambert, 1991], Ch. 6 for an approachable discussion on stiff differential
 * equations and L- and A-Stability.
 *
 * This implementation uses Newton-Raphson (NR) and relies upon the obvious
 * convergence to a solution for `g = 0` where
 * `g(x(t+h)) ≡ x(t+h) − x(t) − h f(t+h,x(t+h))` as `h` becomes sufficiently
 * small. General implementational details for the Newton method were gleaned
 * from Section IV.8 in [Hairer, 1996].
 *
 * ### Error Estimation
 *
 * In this integrator, we simultaneously take a large step at the requested
 * step size of h as well as two half-sized steps each with step size `h/2`.
 * The result from two half-sized steps is propagated as the solution, while
 * the difference between the two results is used as the error estimate for the
 * propagated solution. This error estimate is accurate to the second order.
 *
 * To be precise, let `x̅ⁿ⁺¹` be the computed solution from a large step,
 * `x̃ⁿ⁺¹` be the computed solution from two small steps, and `xⁿ⁺¹` be the true
 * solution. Since the integrator propagates `x̃ⁿ⁺¹` as its solution, we denote
 * the true error vector as `ε = x̃ⁿ⁺¹ − xⁿ⁺¹`. %ImplicitEulerIntegrator uses
 * `ε* = x̅ⁿ⁺¹ − x̃ⁿ⁺¹`, the difference between the two solutions, as the
 * second-order error estimate, because for a smooth system, `‖ε*‖ = O(h²)`,
 * and `‖ε − ε*‖ = O(h³)`. See the notes in get_error_estimate_order() for a
 * detailed derivation of the error estimate's truncation error.
 *
 * In this implementation, %ImplicitEulerIntegrator attempts the large
 * full-sized step before attempting the two small half-sized steps, because
 * the large step is more likely to fail to converge, and if it is performed
 * first, convergence failures are detected early, avoiding the unnecessary
 * effort of computing potentially-successful small steps.
 *
 * Optionally, %ImplicitEulerIntegrator can instead use the implicit trapezoid
 * method for error estimation. However, in our testing the step doubling method
 * substantially outperforms the implicit trapezoid method.

 *
 * @note In the statistics reported by IntegratorBase, all statistics that deal
 * with the number of steps or the step sizes will track the large full-sized
 * steps. This is because the large full-sized `h` is the smallest irrevocable
 * time-increment advanced by this integrator: if, for example, the second small
 * half-sized step fails, this integrator revokes to the state before the first
 * small step. This behavior is similar to other integrators with multi-stage
 * evaluation: the step-counting statistics treat a "step" as the combination of
 * all the stages.
 * @note Furthermore, because the small half-sized steps are propagated as the
 * solution, the large full-sized step is the error estimator, and the error
 * estimation statistics track the effort during the large full-sized step. If
 * the integrator is not in full-Newton mode (see
 * ImplicitIntegrator::set_use_full_newton()), most of the work incurred by
 * constructing and factorizing matrices and by failing Newton-Raphson
 * iterations will be counted toward the error estimation statistics, because
 * the large step is performed first.
 * 
 * @note This integrator uses the integrator accuracy setting, even when run
 *       in fixed-step mode, to limit the error in the underlying Newton-Raphson
 *       process. See IntegratorBase::set_target_accuracy() for more info.

   * Returns the asymptotic order of the difference between the large and small
   * steps (from which the error estimate is computed), which is 2. That is, the
   * error estimate, `ε* = x̅ⁿ⁺¹ − x̃ⁿ⁺¹` has the property that `‖ε*‖ = O(h²)`,
   * and it deviates from the true error, `ε`, by `‖ε − ε*‖ = O(h³)`. 
   *
   * ### Derivation of the asymptotic order
   * 
   * This derivation is based on the same derivation for
   * VelocityImplicitEulerIntegrator, and so the equation numbers are from
   * there.
   *
   * To derive the second-order error estimate, let us first define the
   * vector-valued function `e(tⁿ, h, xⁿ) = x̅ⁿ⁺¹ − xⁿ⁺¹`, the local truncation
   * error for a single, full-sized implicit Euler integration step, with
   * initial conditions `(tⁿ, xⁿ)`, and a step size of `h`. Furthermore, use
   * `ẍ` to denote `df/dt`, and `∇f` and `∇ẍ` to denote the Jacobians `df/dx`
   * and `dẍ/dx` of the ODE system `ẋ = f(t, x)`. Note that `ẍ` uses a total
   * time derivative, i.e., `ẍ = ∂f/∂t + ∇f f`.
   *
   * Let us use `x*` to denote the true solution after a half-step, `x(tⁿ+½h)`,
   * and `x̃*` to denote the implicit Euler solution after a single
   * half-sized step. Furthermore, let us use `xⁿ*¹` to denote the true solution
   * of the system at time `t = tⁿ+h` if the system were at `x̃*` when
   * `t = tⁿ+½h`. See the following diagram for an illustration.
   *

   *            :
   *            xⁿ ───────  x*   ─────── xⁿ⁺¹  <─── true solution
   *
   * We will use superscripts to denote evaluating an expression with `x` at
   * that superscript and `t` at the corresponding time, e.g. `ẍⁿ` denotes
   * `ẍ(tⁿ, xⁿ)`, and `f*` denotes `f(tⁿ+½h, x*)`. We first present a shortened
   * derivation, followed by the longer, detailed version.
   *
   * We know the local truncation error for the implicit Euler method is:
   *
   *     e(tⁿ, h, xⁿ) = x̅ⁿ⁺¹ − xⁿ⁺¹ = ½ h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).                  (10)
   *
   * The local truncation error ε from taking two half steps is composed of
   * these two terms:
   *
   *     e₁ = xⁿ*¹ − xⁿ⁺¹ = (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O₁(h³),                       (15)
   *     e₂ = x̃ⁿ⁺¹ − xⁿ*¹ = (1/8) h²ẍ* + O₂(h³) = (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O₃(h³). (20)
   *
   * In the long derivation, we will show that these second derivatives
   * differ by at most O(h³).
   *
   * Taking the sum,
   *
   *     ε = x̃ⁿ⁺¹ − xⁿ⁺¹ = e₁ + e₂ = (1/4) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).               (21)
   *
   * These two estimations allow us to obtain an estimation of the local error
   * from the difference between the available quantities x̅ⁿ⁺¹ and x̃ⁿ⁺¹:
   *
   *     ε* = x̅ⁿ⁺¹ − x̃ⁿ⁺¹ = e(tⁿ, h, xⁿ) − ε,
   *                      = (1/4) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³),                        (22)
   *
   * and therefore our error estimate is second order.
   *
   * Below we will show this derivation in detail along with the proof that
   * `‖ε − ε*‖ = O(h³)`:
   *
   * Let us look at a single implicit Euler step. Upon Newton-Raphson
   * convergence, the truncation error for implicit Euler is
   *
   *     e(tⁿ, h, xⁿ) = ½ h²ẍⁿ⁺¹ + O(h³)
   *                  = ½ h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).                                (10)
   *
   * To see why the two are equivalent, we can Taylor expand about `(tⁿ, xⁿ)`,
   *
   *     ẍⁿ⁺¹ = ẍⁿ + h dẍ/dtⁿ + O(h²) = ẍⁿ + O(h).
   *     e(tⁿ, h, xⁿ) = ½ h²ẍⁿ⁺¹ + O(h³) = ½ h²(ẍⁿ + O(h)) + O(h³)
   *                  = ½ h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).
   *
   * Moving on with our derivation, after one small half-sized implicit Euler
   * step, the solution `x̃*` is
   *
   *     x̃* = x* + e(tⁿ, ½h, xⁿ)
   *        = x* + (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³),
   *     x̃* − x* = (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).                                 (11)
   *
   * Taylor expanding about `t = tⁿ+½h` in this `x = x̃*` alternate reality,
   *
   *     xⁿ*¹ = x̃* + ½h f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) + O(h²).                          (12)
   *
   * Similarly, Taylor expansions about `t = tⁿ+½h` and the true solution
   * `x = x*` also give us
   *
   *     xⁿ⁺¹ = x* + ½h f* + O(h²),                                    (13)
   *     f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) = f* + (∇f*) (x̃* − x*) + O(‖x̃* − x*‖²)
   *                  = f* + O(h²),                                    (14)
   * where in the last line we substituted Eq. (11).
   *
   * Eq. (12) minus Eq. (13) gives us,
   *
   *     xⁿ*¹ − xⁿ⁺¹ = x̃* − x* + ½h(f(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) − f*) + O(h³),
   *                 = x̃* − x* + O(h³),
   * where we just substituted in Eq. (14). Finally, substituting in Eq. (11),
   *
   *     e₁ = xⁿ*¹ − xⁿ⁺¹ = (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).                        (15)
   *
   * After the second small step, the solution `x̃ⁿ⁺¹` is
   *
   *     x̃ⁿ⁺¹ = xⁿ*¹ + e(tⁿ+½h, ½h, x̃*),
   *          = xⁿ*¹ + (1/8)h² ẍ(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) + O(h³).                   (16)
   *
   * Taking Taylor expansions about `(tⁿ, xⁿ)`,
   *
   *     x* = xⁿ + ½h fⁿ + O(h²) = xⁿ + O(h).                          (17)
   *     x̃* − xⁿ = (x̃* − x*) + (x* − xⁿ) = O(h),                       (18)
   * where we substituted in Eqs. (11) and (17), and
   *
   *     ẍ(tⁿ+½h, x̃*) = ẍⁿ + ½h ∂ẍ/∂tⁿ + ∇ẍⁿ (x̃* − xⁿ) + O(h ‖x̃* − xⁿ‖)
   *                  = ẍⁿ + O(h),                                     (19)
   * where we substituted in Eq. (18).
   *
   * Substituting Eqs. (19) and (15) into Eq. (16),
   *
   *     x̃ⁿ⁺¹ = xⁿ*¹ + (1/8) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³)                              (20)
   *          = xⁿ⁺¹ + (1/4) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³),
   * therefore
   *
   *     ε = x̃ⁿ⁺¹ − xⁿ⁺¹ = (1/4) h² ẍⁿ + O(h³).                        (21)
   *
   * Subtracting Eq. (21) from Eq. (10),
   *
   *     e(tⁿ, h, xⁿ) − ε = (½ − 1/4) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³);
   *     ⇒ ε* = x̅ⁿ⁺¹ − x̃ⁿ⁺¹ = (1/4) h²ẍⁿ + O(h³).                      (22)
   *
   * Eq. (22) shows that our error estimate is second-order. Since the first
   * term on the RHS matches `ε` (Eq. (21)),
   *
   *     ε* = ε + O(h³).                                               (23)
