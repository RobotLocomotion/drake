/**
 A class for advancing the state of hybrid dynamic systems, represented by
 `System<T>` objects, forward in time. Starting with an initial Context for a
 given System, %Simulator advances time and produces a series of Context
 values that forms a trajectory satisfying the system's dynamic equations to
 a specified accuracy. Only the Context is modified by a %Simulator; the
 System is const.

 A Drake System is a continuous/discrete/hybrid dynamic system where the
 continuous part is a DAE, that is, it is expected to consist of a set of
 differential equations and bilateral algebraic constraints. The set of
 active constraints may change as a result of particular events, such as
 contact.

 Given a current Context, we expect a System to provide us with
 - derivatives for the continuous differential equations that already satisfy
   the differentiated form of the constraints (typically, acceleration
   constraints),
 - a projection method for least-squares correction of violated higher-level
   constraints (position and velocity level),
 - a time-of-next-update method that can be used to adjust the integrator
   step size in preparation for a discrete update,
 - methods that can update discrete variables when their update time is
   reached,
 - witness (guard) functions for event isolation,
 - event handlers (reset functions) for making appropriate changes to state
   and mode variables when an event has been isolated.

The continuous parts of the trajectory are advanced using a numerical
integrator. Different integrators have different properties; you can choose
the one that is most appropriate for your application or use the default
which is adequate for most systems.

<h3>How the simulation is stepped: simulation mechanics for authors of discrete
and hybrid systems</h3>

This section is targeted toward users who have created a LeafSystem implementing
a discrete or hybrid system. For authors of such systems, it can be useful to
understand the simulation details in order to attain the desired state behavior
over time. This behavior is dependent on the ordering in which discrete events
and continuous updates are processed. (By "discrete events" we mean to include
any of Drake's event handlers.) The basic issues and terminology are
introduced in the @ref discrete_systems module; please look there first before
proceeding.

As pictured in @ref discrete_systems, when a continuous-time system has
discrete events, the state x can have two significant values at the event
time t. These are
 - x⁻(t), the value of x _before_ the discrete update occurs (○ markers), and
 - x⁺(t), the value of x _after_ the discrete update occurs (● markers).

Thus the value of the Context, which contains both time and state, advances
from {t, x⁻(t)} to {t, x⁺(t)} as a result of the update. While those Context
values are user-visible, the details of stepping here require an intermediate
value which we'll denote {t, x*(t)}.

Recall that Drake's state x is partitioned into continuous, discrete, and
abstract partitions xc, xd, and xa, so `x = { xc, xd, xa }`. Within a single
step, these are updated in three stages:
  -# Unrestricted update (can change x)
  -# Discrete update (can change only xd)
  -# Continuous update (changes t and xc)

Where needed, we extend the above notation to xc⁻, xa⁺, etc. to indicate the
value of an individual partition at a particular stage of the stepping
algorithm.

The following pseudocode uses the above notation to describe the algorithm
"Advance()" that the %Simulator uses to incrementally advance the system
trajectory (time t and state x). We refer to such an advancement as a "substep"
to make it clear that we are not talking about a StepTo() call, which may cause
many substeps to occur. (We'll define StepTo() in terms of Advance() below.) In
general, the length of a substep is not known a priori and is determined by
the Advance() algorithm. Each substep consists of zero or more unrestricted
updates, followed by zero or more discrete updates, followed by (possibly
zero-length) continuous time and state advancement, followed by zero or more
publishes.

The pseudocode will clarify the effects on time and state of each of the update
stages above. This algorithm is given a starting Context value `{tₛ, x⁻(tₛ)}`
and returns an end Context value `{tₑ, x⁻(tₑ)}`, where tₑ is _no later_ than a
given tₘₐₓ.
```
// Advance the trajectory (time and state) from start value {tₛ, x⁻(tₛ)} to an
// end value {tₑ, x⁻(tₑ)}, where tₛ ≤ tₑ ≤ tₘₐₓ.
procedure Advance(tₛ, x⁻(tₛ), tₘₐₓ)

  // Update any variables (no restrictions).
  x*(tₛ) ← DoAnyUnrestrictedUpdates(tₛ, x⁻(tₛ))

  // ----------------------------------
  // Time and state are at {tₛ, x*(tₛ)}
  // ----------------------------------

  // Update discrete variables.
  xd⁺(tₛ) ← DoAnyDiscreteUpdates(tₛ, x*(tₛ))

  xc⁺(tₛ) ← xc*(tₛ)  // These values carry over from x*(tₛ).
  xa⁺(tₛ) ← xa*(tₛ)

  // ----------------------------------
  // Time and state are at {tₛ, x⁺(tₛ)}
  // ----------------------------------

  // See how far it is safe to integrate without missing any events.
  tₑᵥₑₙₜ ← CalcNextEventTime(tₛ, x⁺(tₛ))

  // Integrate continuous variables forward in time. Integration may terminate
  // before reaching tₛₜₒₚ due to witnessed events.
  tₛₜₒₚ ← min(tₑᵥₑₙₜ, tₘₐₓ)
  tₑ, xc⁻(tₑ) ← Integrate(tₛ, x⁺(tₛ), tₛₜₒₚ)

  xd⁻(tₑ) ← xd⁺(tₛ)  // Discrete values are held from x⁺(tₛ).
  xa⁻(tₑ) ← xa⁺(tₛ)

  // ----------------------------------
  // Time and state are at {tₑ, x⁻(tₑ)}
  // ----------------------------------

  DoAnyPublishes(tₑ, x⁻(tₑ))

  return {tₑ, x⁻(tₑ)}
```

We can use the notation and pseudocode to flesh out the StepTo() and
Initialize() functions:
```
// Advance the simulation until time tₘₐₓ.
procedure StepTo(tₘₐₓ)
  t ← current_time
  while t < tₘₐₓ
    {tₑ, x⁻(tₑ)} ← Advance(t, x⁻(t), tₘₐₓ)
    {t, x⁻(t)} ← {tₑ, x⁻(tₑ)}
  endwhile

// Update time and state to {t₀, x⁻(t₀)}, which is the starting value of the
// trajectory, and thus the value the Context should contain at the start of the
// first simulation substep.
procedure Initialize(t₀, x₀)
  x⁺(t₀) ← DoAnyUpdates as in Advance()
  x⁻(t₀) ← x⁺(t₀)  // No continuous update needed.

  // ----------------------------------
  // Time and state are at {t₀, x⁻(t₀)}
  // ----------------------------------

  DoAnyPublishes(t₀, x⁻(t₀))
```
Initialize() can be viewed as a "0ᵗʰ substep" that occurs before the first
Advance() substep as described above. Like Advance(), Initialize() first
performs pending updates (in this case only initialization events can be
"pending"). Time doesn't advance so there is no continuous update phase and
witnesses cannot trigger. Finally, again like Advance(), the initial trajectory
point `{t₀, x⁻(t₀)}` is provided to the handlers for any triggered publish
events. That includes initialization publish events, per-step publish events,
and periodic or timed publish events that trigger at t₀.
