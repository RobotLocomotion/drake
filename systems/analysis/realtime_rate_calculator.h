   Depending on how much wall time has passed, the calculator may find that the
   report period boundary hasn't been reached. Conversely, it may find that
   multiple report periods have elapsed. The return value's `period_count`
   field communicates that state.

     - 0:  Since initialization or last report period boundary, not enough time
           has elapsed and no rate can be computed.
     - >0: With this update, we've crossed `period_count` number of report
           period boundaries. The `rate` value is the rate value for each of
           those periods.

   `period_count` will be zero in the following cases:

     - First invocation (either after construction or calling Reset()).
     - `current_sim_time` is *equal* to the value passed on the previous
       invocation.
     - `current_sim_time` is *strictly less* than the largest value previously
       passed (since last initialization). Furthermore, this resets the
       calculator to the given `current_sim_time` and the wall clock value at
       the time of invocation.
     - The wall clock hasn't advanced at least `report_period` seconds since the
       last reported rate.  */
