 * by providing the @p make_simulator factory method to return a Simulator
 * using the supplied RandomGenerator as the only source of randomness.
 * This interface was designed to support cases where the System/Diagram is
 * random (not only the Context), e.g. in the case where are variable number
 * of objects are added to a multibody simulation.
 *
 * @param output  The scalar random variable output, denoted @p output, is
 * defined as a function of the Simulator's System's Context, evaluated at
 * the @p final_time.  Monte-Carlo investigations that studying the details
 * of an entire trajectory can still use this interface, e.g. by including a
 * "runtime monitor" System that latches the worst-case deviation of a
 * specification into it's Context to be queried at the final time.
 *
 * @param final_time  The time that each instance of the Simulator is
 * stepped to.  In many cases, this will be equivalent to the duration of
 * the simulation, but it need not be because SetRandomContext() could
 * initialize the time to a non-zero value, or an event could trigger
 * premature termination of the simulation (see #4447).
 *
 * @param generator Random number generator to be used to generate the
 * random samples.
 *
 * @return the @p output evaluated from the Context at @p final_time.
