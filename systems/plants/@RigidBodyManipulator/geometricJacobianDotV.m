% Implementation makes use of the fact that
% d/dt(twist) = J * vdot + Jdot * v
% If we set vdot to zero, then Jdot * v can be found using any algorithm
% that computes the relative spatial acceleration between base and
% endEffector, expressed in expressedIn.
% The relative spatial acceleration is the sum of the spatial accelerations
% across the individual joints (with vdot set to zero), transformed to
% expressedIn frame before addition.
