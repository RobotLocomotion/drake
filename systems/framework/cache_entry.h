/** A %CacheEntry belongs to a System and represents the properties of one of
that System's cached computations. %CacheEntry objects are assigned CacheIndex
values in the order they are declared; these are unique within a single System
and can be used for quick access to both the %CacheEntry and the corresponding
CacheEntryValue in the System's Context.

%CacheEntry objects are allocated automatically for known System computations
like output ports and time derivatives, and may also be allocated by user code
for other cached computations.

A cache entry's value is always stored as an AbstractValue, which can hold a
concrete value of any copyable type. However, once a value has been allocated
using a particular concrete type, the type cannot be changed.

%CacheEntry objects support four important operations:
- Allocate() returns an object that can hold the cached value.
- Calc() unconditionally computes the cached value.
- Eval() returns a reference to the cached value, first updating with Calc()
    if it was out of date.
- GetKnownUpToDate() returns a reference to the current value that you are
    certain must already be up to date.

The allocation and calculation functions must be provided at the time a
cache entry is declared. That is typically done in a System constructor, in
a manner very similar to the declaration of output ports. */

  This method is intended only for use by the framework which provides much
  nicer APIs for end users. See
  @ref DeclareCacheEntry_documentation "DeclareCacheEntry" for the
  user-facing API documentation.

  The supplied allocator must return a suitable AbstractValue in which to
  hold the result. The supplied calculator function must write to an
  AbstractValue of the same underlying concrete type as is returned by the
  allocator. The allocator function is not invoked here during construction of
  the cache entry. Instead allocation is deferred until the allocator can be
  provided with a complete Context, which cannot occur until the full Diagram
  containing this subsystem has been completed. That way the initial type, size,
  or value can Context-dependent. The supplied prerequisite tickets are
  interpreted as belonging to the same subsystem that owns this %CacheEntry.

  The list of prerequisites cannot be empty -- a cache entry that really has
  no prerequisites must say so explicitly by providing a list containing only
  `nothing_ticket()` as a prerequisite. The subsystem pointer must not be null,
  and the cache index and ticket must be valid. The description is an arbitrary
  string not interpreted in any way by Drake.
