  /** @name  (Internal use only) Event handler dispatch mechanism
  The pure virtuals declared here are intended to be implemented only by
  Drake's LeafSystem and Diagram (plus a few unit tests) and those
  implementations must be `final`.

  For a LeafSystem, these functions need to call the appropriate LeafSystem::DoX
  event dispatcher. E.g. LeafSystem::DispatchPublishHandler() calls
  LeafSystem::DoPublish(). User supplied custom event callbacks embedded in each
  individual event need to be invoked in the LeafSystem::DoX handlers if
  desired. For a LeafSystem, the pseudo code of the complete default publish
  event handler dispatching is roughly:
  <pre>
    leaf_sys.Publish(context, event_collection)
    -> leaf_sys.DispatchPublishHandler(context, event_collection)
       -> leaf_sys.DoPublish(context, event_collection.get_events())
          -> for (event : event_collection_events):
               if (event.has_handler)
                 event.handler(context)
  </pre>
  Discrete update events and unrestricted update events are dispatched
  similarly for a LeafSystem. EventStatus is propagated upwards from the
  individual event handlers with the first worst retained.

  For a Diagram, these functions must iterate through all subsystems, extract
  their corresponding subcontext and subevent collections from `context` and
  `events`, and pass those to the subsystems' public non-virtual event
  dispatchers if the subevent collection is nonempty (e.g. System::Publish()
  for publish events).

  All of these functions are only called from their corresponding public
  non-virtual event dispatchers, where `context` is error checked. The
  derived implementations can assume that `context` is valid. See, e.g.,
  LeafSystem::DispatchPublishHandler() and Diagram::DispatchPublishHandler()
  for more details. */
