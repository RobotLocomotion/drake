  /** @name                 Event handler dispatch mechanism
  For a LeafSystem (or user implemented equivalent classes), these functions
  need to call the appropriate LeafSystem::DoX event handler. E.g.
  LeafSystem::DispatchPublishHandler() calls LeafSystem::DoPublish(). User
  supplied custom event callbacks embedded in each individual event need to
  be further dispatched in the LeafSystem::DoX handlers if desired. For a
  LeafSystem, the pseudo code of the complete default publish event handler
  dispatching is roughly:
  <pre>
    leaf_sys.Publish(context, event_collection)
    -> leaf_sys.DispatchPublishHandler(context, event_collection)
       -> leaf_sys.DoPublish(context, event_collection.get_events())

               if (event.has_handler)
                 event.handler(context)
  </pre>
  Discrete update events and unrestricted update events are dispatched
  similarly for a LeafSystem.

  For a Diagram (or user implemented equivalent classes), these functions
  must iterate through all subsystems, extract their corresponding
  subcontext and subevent collections from @p context and @p events,
  and pass those to the subsystems' public non-virtual event handlers if
  the subevent collection is nonempty (e.g. System::Publish() for publish
  events).

  All of these functions are only called from their corresponding public
  non-virtual event dispatchers, where @p context is error checked. The
  derived implementations can assume that @p context is valid. See, e.g.,
  LeafSystem::DispatchPublishHandler() and Diagram::DispatchPublishHandler()
