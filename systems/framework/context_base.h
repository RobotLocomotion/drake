/** Provides non-templatized functionality shared by the templatized derived
classes. That includes caching and dependency tracking, and management of
local values for fixed input ports.

Terminology: in general a Drake System is a tree structure composed of
"subsystems", which are themselves System objects. The corresponding Context is
a parallel tree structure composed of "subcontexts", which are themselves
Context objects. There is a one-to-one correspondence between subsystems and
subcontexts. Within a given System (Context), its child subsystems (subcontexts)
are indexed using a SubsystemIndex; there is no separate SubcontextIndex since
the numbering must be identical. */
