//                             CACHE ENTRY VALUE
//==============================================================================
/** This is the representation in the Context for the value of one of a System's
CacheEntry objects. It consists of a single type-erased value, a serial number,
an `out_of_date` flag, and a DependencyTracker ticket. Details:
- "Out of date" means that some prerequisite of this cache entry's computation
  has been changed in the current Context since the stored value was last
  computed, and thus must be recomputed prior to use. On the other hand, if the
  entry is _not_ out of date, then it is "up to date" meaning that if you were
  to recompute it using the current Context values you would get the identical
  result (so don't bother!).
- The "serial number" is an integer that is incremented whenever the value is
  modified, or made available for mutable access. You can use it to recognize
  that you are looking at the same value as you saw at some earlier time. It is
  also useful for performance studies since it is a count of how many times this
  value was recomputed. Note that marking the value "out of date" is _not_ a
  modification; that does not change the serial number. The serial number is
  maintained internally and cannot be user-modified.
- The DependencyTicket ("ticket") stored here identifies the DependencyTracker
  ("tracker") associated with this cache entry. The tracker maintains lists of
  all upstream prerequisites and downstream dependents of the value stored here,
  and also has a pointer to this %CacheEntryValue that it uses for invalidation.
  Upstream modifications cause the tracker to set the `out_of_date` flag here,
  and mark all downstream dependents out of date also. The tracker lives in
  the same subcontext that owns the Cache that owns this %CacheEntryValue.

We sometimes use the terms "invalid" and "invalidate" as synonyms for "out of
date" and "mark out of date".

For debugging purposes, caching may be disabled for an entire Context or for
particular cache entry values. This is independent of the `out_of_date` flag
described above, which is still expected to be operational when caching is
disabled. However, when caching is disabled the Eval() methods will recompute
the contained value even if it is not marked out of date. That should have no
effect other than to slow computation; if results change, something is wrong.
There could be a problem with the specification of dependencies, a bug in user
code such as improper retention of a stale reference, or a bug in the caching
system. */
