/** Manages value interdependencies for a particular value or set of values in
a Context.

A %DependencyTracker ("tracker" for short) provides notifications of changes to
the managed value to downstream subscribers, and may invalidate an associated
cache entry. The "managed value" can be a source like time or state, or a cached
computation. A particular tracker is selected using a DependencyTicket
("ticket") which provides very fast access to the tracker. The ticket is used by
both the System and Context as a way to identify dependencies, while trackers
exist only in the Context.

Each %DependencyTracker manages dependencies for a value, or group of related
values, upon which some downstream computations may depend, and maintains lists
of downstream dependents (subscribers) and upstream prerequisites. An optional
CacheEntryValue may be registered with a tracker in which case the tracker will
mark the cache value out of date when one of its prerequisites has changed.

A single %DependencyTracker can represent interdependencies within its
subcontext, and to and from other subcontexts within the same containing Context
tree. Trackers are always owned by a DependencyGraph that is part of a
particular subcontext, and should always be created through methods of
DependencyGraph; don't construct them directly yourself.

%DependencyTracker objects within a Context are nodes in a directed acylic graph
formed by "is-prerequisite-of" edges leading from source values (like time,
state, parameters, and input ports) to dependent cached computations and output
ports. A %DependencyTracker maintains lists of both its downstream subscribers
and its upstream prerequisites. The entries in both lists are pointers to other
%DependencyTrackers. That requires special handling when cloning a Context,
since the internal pointers to the %DependencyTracker objects in the source must
be replaced by their corresponding pointers in the copy.

%DependencyTrackers may simply group upstream values, without representing a
new value or computation. For example, the three continuous state subgroups
q, v, and z are each associated with their own %DependencyTracker. There is
also a tracker that monitors changes to _any_ variable within the entire
collection of continuous variables `xc≜{q,v,z}`; that tracker
subscribes to the three individual trackers. Similarly, individual discrete
variable groups dᵢ collectively determine the discrete state `xd≜{dᵢ}`,
individual abstract state variables aᵢ determine the abstract state `xa≜{aᵢ}`,
and the full state is `x≜{xc,xd,xa}`. Here is a graph showing
time and state trackers and some hypothetical cache entry trackers.
<pre>
                   (q)--------➙(position kinematics)
                      ➘
                 (v)--➙(xc)---     (time)----➙(xc_dot)
                 (z)--➚       ╲              ➚
                               ➘            ╱
                (d₀)--➙(xd)---➙(x)----------
                (d₁)--➚        ➚
                              ╱
                (a₀)--➙(xa)---
                (a₁)--➚
</pre>
The parenthesized nodes are %DependencyTrackers for the indicated values, and
a directed edge `(a)->(b)` can be read as "a is-prerequisite-of b" or
"a determines b". The graph also maintains reverse-direction edges (not shown).
A reversed edge `(a)<-(b)` could be read as "b subscribes-to a" or
"b depends-on a".)

These grouped trackers simplify dependency specification for quantities that
depend on many sources, which is very common. For example, they allow a user to
express a dependence on "all the inputs" without actually having to
know how many inputs there are, which might change over time. Grouped trackers
also serve to reduce the total number of edges in the dependency graph,
providing faster invalidation. For example, if there are 10 computations
dependent on q, v, and z (which frequently change together) we would have 30
edges. Introducing (xc) reduces that to 13 edges.

Downstream computations may subscribe to any of the individual or grouped
nodes. */

// Implementation notes:
// Invalidation operations occur very frequently at run time and must execute
// very fast. To make invalidation an O(N) operation, it is essential to avoid
// unnecessary repeated invalidations of the same subgraph during an
// invalidation sweep. That is handled via a unique "change event"
// serial number that is stored in a tracker when it is first invalidated.
// Encountering a node with a matching change event number terminates that
// branch of an invalidation sweep using that change event. Calling code can
// improve performance further by grouping simultaneous changes (say time and
// state) together into a single change event.
//
// Lots of things can go wrong so we maintain lots of redundant information here
// and check it religiously in Debug builds, less so in Release builds.
//
// For maximum speed, DependencyTracker objects contain pointers to other
// trackers within the same containing Context tree. That is, the referenced
// trackers can be in any subcontext that shares the same root Context as the
// subcontext that owns this tracker; they are not necessarily limited to
// trackers within the same subcontext. There is also
// a pointer to the containing Context's system pathname service for use in
// logging and error messages. These pointers provide great performance but
// make DependencyTrackers hard to clone because the pointers have to be set to
// point to corresponding entries in the new copy.
//
// DependencyTrackers for cache entries have to invalidate the associated cache
// value when notified of prerequisite changes. That simply sets a bool that is
// maintained by the CacheEntryValue object. This is an inner loop activity
// that must be done very efficiently. It is faster to invalidate with
// unconditional, inline code than to have a runtime test or abstract interface
// for cache invalidation. To permit that, we allocate a static dummy
// CacheEntryValue here, make it available for all non-cache DependencyTrackers
// to "invalidate", and require that the definition of the cache invalidation
// method is visible here rather than use an abstract interface to it.
