/// DiagramBuilder is a factory class for Diagram.
///
/// It is single use: after calling Build or BuildInto, DiagramBuilder gives up
/// ownership of the constituent systems, and should therefore be discarded;
/// all member functions will throw an exception after this point.
///
/// When a Diagram (or DiagramBuilder) that owns systems is destroyed, the
/// systems will be destroyed in the reverse of the order they were added.
///
/// A system must be added to the DiagramBuilder with AddSystem or
/// AddNamedSystem before it can be wired up in any way. Every system must have
/// a unique, non-empty name.
///
/// @anchor DiagramBuilder_feedthrough
/// <h2>Building large Diagrams</h2>
///
/// When building large Diagrams with many added systems and input-output port
/// connections, the runtime performance of DiagramBuilder::Build() might become
/// relevant.
///
/// As part of its correctness checks, the DiagramBuilder::Build() function
/// performs a graph search of the diagram's dependencies. In the graph, the
/// nodes are the child systems that have been added to the diagram, and the
/// edges are the diagram connections from one child's output port to another
/// child's input port(s). The builder must confirm that the graph is acyclic;
/// a cycle would imply an infinite loop in an output calculation function.
/// With a large graph, this check can be computationally expensive. To speed
/// it up, ensure that your output ports do not gratuitously depend on
/// irrelevant input ports.
///
/// The dependencies are supplied via the `prerequisites_of_calc` argument to
/// DeclareOutputPort family of functions.  If the default value is used (i.e.,
/// when no prerequisites are provided), the default is to assume the output
/// port value is dependent on all possible sources.
///
/// Refer to the
/// @ref DeclareLeafOutputPort_feedthrough "Direct feedthrough"
/// documentation for additional details and examples.  In particular, the
/// SystemBase::all_sources_except_input_ports_ticket() is a convenient
/// shortcut for outputs that do not depend on any inputs.
