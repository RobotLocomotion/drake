  /// @anchor context_value_change_methods
  /// @name           Methods for changing locally-stored values
  /// Methods in this group allow changes to the values of quantities stored
  /// locally in this %Context. The changeable quantities are:
  ///
  /// - time
  /// - state
  /// - parameters
  /// - accuracy
  /// - fixed input port values
  ///
  /// Expensive computations may be performed that depend on the current values
  /// of some or all of the above quantities. For efficiency, we save the
  /// results of such computations in the %Context so that we can reuse
  /// those results without unnecessary recomputation.
  ///
  /// <h3>Terminology</h3>
  /// We call a quantity whose value is needed in order to perform a particular
  /// computation a _prerequisite_ of that computation, and we say that the
  /// computation is a _dependent_ of that prerequisite. If a prerequisite's
  /// value changes, a result computed using an earlier value is _invalid_; we
  /// say that the prerequisite change _invalidates_ that result, and that the
  /// result is _out of date_ with respect to its prerequisites. It is important
  /// to note that the result of one computation can serve as a prerequisite to
  /// another computation; we call the dependent computation a _downstream_
  /// computation and the prerequisite an _upstream_ computation.
  ///
  /// <h3>Caching</h3>
  /// Drake provides a caching system that is responsible for
  ///
  /// - storing computed results in the %Context's _cache_, and
  /// - ensuring that any cached result that _may_ be invalid is marked
  ///   "out of date".
  ///
  /// The correctness of results reported by Drake depends critically on _every_
  /// cached result being correctly flagged as up to date or out of date with
  /// respect to its prerequisites. Only when it is known _for certain_ that
  /// a result is valid can it be marked up to date. Access to cached results
  /// is performed through `Eval()` methods that return up to date results
  /// immediately but initiate recomputation first for results marked out of
  /// date. The methods in the group below are responsible for ensuring that
  /// cached results are marked out of date whenever a prerequisite value may
  /// have changed. These methods _do not_ initiate such recomputation
  /// themselves.
  ///
  /// @sa @ref cache_design_notes
  ///
  /// <h3>Invalidation and "out of date" notification</h3>
  /// Each method in this group provides the ability to change a particular
  /// subset of the available quantities listed above. This triggers "out of
  /// date" notifications to the cached results for all computations for which
  /// any element of that subset is a prerequisite. Such notifications
  /// propagate to downstream computations, whose cached results may reside
  /// anywhere in the full Diagram context tree of which this %Context is a
  /// part. That ensures that "out of date" flags are set correctly for the
  /// cached results of all computations that could be made invalid by a value
  /// change to any of the affected subset of quantities. We call this
  /// process a _notification sweep_.
  ///
  /// <h3>Which method to use</h3>
  /// Choose the most-specific method in this group that permits you to perform
  /// the modifications you need. For example, if you need to modify only
  /// continuous state variables, don't use a method that provides mutable
  /// access to the whole state. That provides two performance advantages:
  /// - fewer downstream computations need to be marked out of date, making the
  ///   notification sweep faster, and
  /// - fewer results will need to be recomputed later.
  ///
  /// The methods below may be grouped into "safe" methods that only set values
  /// in the context, and "dangerous" methods return a mutable reference. In
  /// addition, the `FixInputPort` methods return an object that has its own
  /// dangerous methods (see FixedInputPortValue). Prefer the safe methods when
  /// possible.
  ///
  /// <h4>Safe "Set" methods</h4>
  /// The `set` and `Set` methods that don't also contain `GetMutable` in their
  /// names are safe in the sense that they perform both the "mark as out of
  /// date" notification sweep through dependent cached results and the update
  /// to the local quantity's value. They do not return a reference to the value
  /// object. Using these methods ensures that no value modification can occur
  /// without an appropriate notification sweep. Also, these methods can be used
  /// to perform multiple changes at once (say time and state), requiring only a
  /// single notification sweep, and _may_ perform optimizations to avoid
  /// notifications in case some of the new values are the same as the old ones.
  ///
  /// <h4>Dangerous "GetMutable" methods</h4>
  /// @anchor dangerous_get_mutable
  /// The `GetMutable` methods return a mutable reference to the local value
  /// object within this %Context. The notification sweep is done prior to
  /// returning that reference. You can then use the reference to make the
  /// desired change. Note that with these methods we do not actually know
  /// whether dependent computations are invalid; that depends what you do with
  /// the reference once you have it. Nevertheless you will pay the cost of
  /// the notifications sweep immediately and the cost of recomputation later
  /// when you ask for the value. So don't call one of these methods unless
  /// you are certain you will be writing through the returned reference.
  ///
  /// You _must not_ hold on to the returned reference expecting
  /// to be able to make subsequent changes, because those changes can't be
  /// seen by the framework and thus will not cause the necessary notification
  /// sweep to occur. Instead, request the mutable reference again when
  /// you need it so that the necessary notification sweep can be performed.
  ///
  /// The dangerous methods are segregated into their own
  /// @ref dangerous_context_value_change_methods "documentation group".
  ///
  /// <h4>Advanced context-modifying methods</h4>
  /// Specialized methods are provided for expert users implementing
  /// integrators and other state-modifying solvers. Those are segregated to
  /// a separate
  /// @ref advanced_context_value_change_methods "documentation group".
  /// <!-- TODO(sherm1) The "get mutable" methods here should be moved to
  ///      the Advanced section also once we have civilized replacements
  ///      for them. -->
  ///
  /// <h3>Implementation note</h3>
  /// Each method in the group below guarantees to mark as out of date any
  /// dependents of the quantities to which it permits modification, including
  /// all downstream dependents. However, the current implementations may also
  /// perform some unnecessary notifications. If so, that is noted in the method
