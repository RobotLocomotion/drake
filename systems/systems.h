/// @brief Drake uses a Simulink-inspired description of dynamical systems.
///
/// Includes basic building blocks (adders, integrators, delays, etc),
/// physics models of mechanical systems, and a growing list of sensors,
/// actuators, controllers, planners, estimators.
///
/// All dynamical systems derive from the drake::systems::System base class, and
/// must explicitly declare all drake::systems::State,
/// drake::systems::Parameters, and noise/disturbances inputs. The
/// drake::systems::Diagram class permits modeling complex systems from
/// libraries of parts.
///
/// For an introduction to using systems in python, see the dynamical_systems
/// tutorial.  For a "Hello, World!" example of writing a dynamical system in
/// C++, see simple_continuous_time_system.cc and/or
/// simple_discrete_time_system.cc.

/// Drake provides a variety of capabilities for sensor modeling. Some sensors
/// are offered as Systems in a block diagram. These sensors are listed in the
/// following section as classes. On the other hand, Drake has some internal
/// functionalities, which can be used to model a sensor. The
/// **Force/Torque Sensor** falls into this catergory.
///
/// A **Force/Torque Sensor** measures nothing but the reaction force/torque
/// of a @ref drake::multibody::WeldJoint "WeldJoint". The
/// @ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant "MultibodyPlant" class provides the
/// @ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant::get_reaction_forces_output_port()
/// "get_reaction_forces_output_port()" method that returns the reaction
/// @ref drake::multibody::SpatialForce "SpatialForce" of all the joints. You
/// only need to extract the entries for the joints in which you are interested.
/// To simulate a Force/Torque sensor, you need to either a) define a
/// fixed joint for the force/torque sensor in the SDF/URDF model file or
/// b) add a @ref drake::multibody::WeldJoint "WeldJoint" between two bodies.
/// This joint will then serve as the Force/Torque sensor. You can also
/// refer to *planar_gripper* for an example.
