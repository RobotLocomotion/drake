  std::string renderer_name{"default"};

  /** The choice of render engine implementation to use. It can be specified
   simply by providing a `string` containing the class _name_ of the
   RenderEngine to use (i.e., `"RenderEngineVtk"`, `"RenderEngineGl"`, or
   `"RenderEngineGltfClient"`). Or, it can be specified by providing parameters
   for one of those engines: RenderEngineVtkParams, RenderEngineGlParams, or
   RenderEngineGltfClientParams.

   If a `string` containing the render engine class _name_ is provided, the
   engine instantiated will use the default parameters -- equivalent to passing
   the set of default parameters.

   It is possible for multiple cameras to reference the same `renderer_name`
   but configure the renderer differently. This would be a configuration error.
   The following rules will help prevent problematic configurations:

     - Multiple cameras can reference the same value for `renderer_name`.
     - If multiple cameras reference the same value for `renderer_name`, only
       the *first* can use the engine parameters to specify it. Attempting to
       do so with a later camera will produce an error.
       - The later cameras can use engine class _name_.
       - If a later camera names a *different* engine class, that will result
         in an error.

   In YAML, it can be a bit trickier. Depending on how a collection of cameras
   is articulated, the concept of "first" may be unclear. In
   `examples/hardware_sim/scenario.h` the collection is a map. So, the camera
   configurations are not necessarily processed in the order they appear in the
   YAML file. Instead, the processing order depends on the mnemonic camera key.
   So, be aware, if you use a similar mapping, you may have to massage the key
   names to achieve the requisite processing order. Alternatively, a vector of
   %CameraConfig in your own scenario file, would guarantee that processing
   order is the same as file order.

   We intend to relax these restrictions in time, allowing equivalent, redundant
   specifications of a render engine (and throwing only on inconsistent
   specifications).

   Passing the empty string is equivalent to saying, "I don't care". If a render
   engine with that name has already been configured, the camera will use it
   (regardless of type). If the name doesn't already exist, the default, slower,
   more portable, and more robust RenderEngineVtk will be instantiated.
   RenderEngineGl can be selected if you are on Ubuntu and need the improved
   performance (at the *possible* cost of lesser image fidelity). In YAML,
   omitting `renderer_class` from the camera specification is equivalent to
   "passing the empty string".

   <h4>Configuring in YAML</h4>

   It isn't always obvious what the proper spelling in YAML is. The following
   examples illustrate how the `renderer_class` field can be defined in YAML
   files.

   1. Use the RenderEngineVtk with all default parameters - providing the class
      name as a string.
   @code{yaml}
   renderer_class: RenderEngineVtk
   @endcode

   2. Use the RenderEngineVtk with all default parameters - providing the
      engine parameters with default values.
   @code{yaml}
   renderer_class: !RenderEngineVtkParams {}
   @endcode

   3. Use the RenderEngineVtk with a customized clear color (black).
   @code{yaml}
   renderer_class: !RenderEngineVtkParams
     default_clear_color: [0, 0, 0]
   @endcode

   4. Use the RenderEngineGl with a customized clear color (black).
   @code{yaml}
   renderer_class: !RenderEngineGlParams
     default_clear_color:
       rgba: [0, 0, 0, 1]
   @endcode

   5. Use the RenderEngineGltfClient with fully specified properties.
   @code{yaml}
   renderer_class: !RenderEngineGltfClientParams
     base_url: http://10.10.10.1
     render_endpoint: server
     verbose: true
     cleanup: false
   @endcode

   6. Explicitly request Drake's default render engine.
   @code{yaml}
   renderer_class: ""
   @endcode

   Things to note:

     - When providing the _parameters_ for the engine, the declaration must
       begin with `!` to announce it as a type (examples 2, 3, and 4).
     - A defaulted set of parameters must have a trailing `{}` (example 2).
     - Two engine parameter sets may have the same semantic parameter but spell
       it differently (`default_clear_color` in examples 3 and 4).

   @pre `renderer_class` is a string and either empty or one of
        `"RenderEngineVtk"`, `"RenderEngineGl"`, or `"RenderEngineGltfClient"`,
        or, it is a parameter type of one of Drake's RenderEngine
        implementations.
