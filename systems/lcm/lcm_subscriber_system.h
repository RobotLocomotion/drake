/**
 * Receives LCM messages from a given channel and outputs them to a
 * System<double>'s port. This class stores the most recently processed LCM
 * message in the State. When a LCM message arrives asynchronously, an update
 * event is scheduled to process the message and store it in the State at the
 * earliest possible simulation time. The output is always consistent with the
 * State.
 *
 * To process a LCM message, CalcNextUpdateTime() needs to be called first to
 * check for new messages and schedule a callback event if a new LCM message
 * has arrived. The message is then processed and stored in the Context by
 * CalcUnrestrictedUpdate(). When this system is evaluated by the Simulator,
 * all these operations are taken care of by the Simulator. On the other hand,
 * the user needs to manually replicate this process without the Simulator.
 *
 * If LCM service in use is a drake::lcm::DrakeLcmLog (not live operation),
 * then see drake::systems::lcm::LcmLogPlaybackSystem for a helper to advance
 * the log cursor in concert with the simulation.
