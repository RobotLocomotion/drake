/** The %ContactSurface characterizes the intersection of two geometries M
  and N as a contact surface with a scalar field and a vector field, whose
  purpose is to support the hydroelastic pressure field contact model as
  described in:

      R. Elandt, E. Drumwright, M. Sherman, and Andy Ruina. A pressure
      field model for fast, robust approximation of net contact force
      and moment between nominally rigid objects. IROS 2019: 8238-8245.

  <h2> Mathematical Concepts </h2>

  In this section, we give motivation for the concept of contact surface from
  the hydroelastic pressure field contact model. Here the mathematical
  discussion is coordinate-free (treatment of the topic without reference to
  any particular coordinate system); however, our implementation heavily
  relies on coordinate frames. We borrow terminology from differential
  geometry.

  In this section, the mathematical term _compact set_ (a subset of Euclidean
  space that is closed and bounded) corresponds to the term _geometry_ (or the
  space occupied by the geometry) in SceneGraph.

  We describe the contact surface 𝕊ₘₙ between two intersecting compact subsets
  𝕄 and ℕ of ℝ³ with the scalar fields eₘ and eₙ defined on 𝕄 ⊂ ℝ³ and ℕ ⊂ ℝ³
  respectively:

                 eₘ : 𝕄 → ℝ,
                 eₙ : ℕ → ℝ.

  The _contact surface_ 𝕊ₘₙ is the surface of equilibrium eₘ = eₙ. It is the
  locus of points Q where eₘ(Q) equals eₙ(Q):

               𝕊ₘₙ = { Q ∈ 𝕄 ∩ ℕ : eₘ(Q) = eₙ(Q) }.

  We can define the scalar field eₘₙ on the surface 𝕊ₘₙ as a scalar function
  that assigns Q ∈ 𝕊ₘₙ the value of eₘ(Q), which is the same as eₙ(Q):

               eₘₙ : 𝕊ₘₙ → ℝ,
               eₘₙ(Q) = eₘ(Q) = eₙ(Q).

  We can also define the scalar field hₘₙ on 𝕄 ∩ ℕ as the difference between
  eₘ and eₙ:

               hₘₙ : 𝕄 ∩ ℕ → ℝ,
               hₘₙ(Q) = eₘ(Q) - eₙ(Q).

  It follows that the gradient vector field ∇hₘₙ on 𝕄 ∩ ℕ equals the difference
  between the gradient vector fields ∇eₘ and ∇eₙ:

               ∇hₘₙ : 𝕄 ∩ ℕ → ℝ³,
               ∇hₘₙ(Q) = ∇eₘ(Q) - ∇eₙ(Q).

  By construction, Q ∈ 𝕊ₘₙ if and only if hₘₙ(Q) = 0. In other words, 𝕊ₘₙ is
  the zero level set of hₘₙ. It follows that, for Q ∈ 𝕊ₘₙ, ∇hₘₙ(Q) is
  orthogonal to the surface 𝕊ₘₙ at Q in the direction of increasing eₘ - eₙ.
  <!-- Note from PR discussion
    1. `∇hₘₙ` *is* a well-behaved vector (subject to some assumptions -- see
        below).
    2. The contact surface "clips" intersecting geometries M and N into disjoint
       geometries M' and N'. `∇hₘₙ` points *out* of M' and *into* N'.
    Assumptions:
    - `∇e` is differentiable and "points outward"

   TODO(DamrongGuoy):
   1. Document the above listed properties of `∇hₘₙ`.
   2. Add a todo indicating M' and N' should be illustrated in the docs.
   3. Explicitly add the assumptions on `e` that make this interpretation valid.
  -->

  Notice that the domain of eₘₙ is the two-dimensional surface 𝕊ₘₙ, while the
  domain of ∇hₘₙ is the three-dimensional compact set 𝕄 ∩ ℕ.
  Even though eₘₙ and ∇hₘₙ are defined on different domains (𝕊ₘₙ and 𝕄 ∩ ℕ),
  our implementation only represents them on their common domain, i.e., 𝕊ₘₙ.

  <h2> Discrete Representation </h2>

  In practice, the contact surface is approximated with a discrete triangle
  mesh. The triangle mesh's normals are defined *per face*. The normal of each
  face is guaranteed to point "out of" N and "into" M. They can be accessed via
  `mesh_W().face_normal(face_index)`.

  The pressure values on the contact surface are represented as a continuous,
  piecewise-linear function, accessed via e_MN().

  The normals of the mesh are discontinuous at triangle boundaries, but the
  pressure can be meaningfully evaluated over the entire domain of the mesh.

  When available, the values of ∇eₘ and ∇eₙ are represented as a discontinuous,
  piecewise-constant function over the triangles -- one vector per triangle.
  These quantities are accessed via EvaluateGradE_M_W() and EvaluateGradE_N_W(),
  respectively.

  <h2> Barycentric Coordinates </h2>

  For Point Q on the surface mesh of the contact surface between Geometry M and
  Geometry N, r_WQ = (x,y,z) is the displacement vector from the origin of the
  world frame to Q expressed in the coordinate frame of W. We also have the
  _barycentric coordinates_ (b0, b1, b2) on a triangle of the surface mesh that
  contains Q. With vertices of the triangle labeled as v₀, v₁, v₂, we can
  map (b0, b1, b2) to r_WQ by:

               r_WQ = b0 * r_Wv₀ + b1 * r_Wv₁ + b2 * r_Wv₂,
               b0 + b1 + b2 = 1, bᵢ ∈ [0,1],

  where r_Wvᵢ is the displacement vector of the vertex labeled as vᵢ from the
  origin of the world frame, expressed in the world frame.

  We use the barycentric coordinates to evaluate the field values.

   The %ContactSurface *provisionally* includes the gradients of the constituent

   these values to be included in an instance, the gradient for the
   corresponding mesh must be well defined. For example a rigid mesh will not
   have a well-defined pressure gradient; as stiffness goes to infinity, the
   geometry becomes rigid and the gradient _direction_ converges to the
   direction of the rigid mesh's surface normals, but the magnitude goes to
   infinity, producing a pressure gradient that would be some variant of
   `<∞, ∞, ∞>`.

   Accessing the gradient values must be pre-conditioned on a test that the
   particular instance of %ContactSurface actually contains the gradient data.
   The presence of gradient data for each geometry must be confirmed separately.
