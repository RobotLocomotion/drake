      field model for fast, robust approximation of net contact force
      and moment between nominally rigid objects. IROS 2019: 8238-8245.

  <h2> Mathematical Concepts </h2>

  In this section, we give motivation for the concept of contact surface from
  the hydroelastic pressure field contact model. Here the mathematical
  discussion is coordinate-free (treatment of the topic without reference to
  any particular coordinate system); however, our implementation heavily
  relies on coordinate frames. We borrow terminology from differential
  geometry.

  In this section, the mathematical term _compact set_ (a subset of Euclidean
  space that is closed and bounded) corresponds to the term _geometry_ (or the
  space occupied by the geometry) in SceneGraph.

  We describe the contact surface 𝕊ₘₙ between two intersecting compact subsets
  𝕄 and ℕ of ℝ³ with the scalar fields eₘ and eₙ defined on 𝕄 ⊂ ℝ³ and ℕ ⊂ ℝ³
  respectively:

                 eₘ : 𝕄 → ℝ,
                 eₙ : ℕ → ℝ.

  The _contact surface_ 𝕊ₘₙ is the surface of equilibrium eₘ = eₙ. It is the
  locus of points Q where eₘ(Q) equals eₙ(Q):

               𝕊ₘₙ = { Q ∈ 𝕄 ∩ ℕ : eₘ(Q) = eₙ(Q) }.

  We can define the scalar field eₘₙ on the surface 𝕊ₘₙ as a scalar function
  that assigns Q ∈ 𝕊ₘₙ the value of eₘ(Q), which is the same as eₙ(Q):

               eₘₙ : 𝕊ₘₙ → ℝ,
               eₘₙ(Q) = eₘ(Q) = eₙ(Q).

  We can also define the scalar field hₘₙ on 𝕄 ∩ ℕ as the difference between
  eₘ and eₙ:

               hₘₙ : 𝕄 ∩ ℕ → ℝ,
               hₘₙ(Q) = eₘ(Q) - eₙ(Q).

  It follows that the gradient vector field ∇hₘₙ on 𝕄 ∩ ℕ equals the difference
  between the gradient vector fields ∇eₘ and ∇eₙ:

               ∇hₘₙ : 𝕄 ∩ ℕ → ℝ³,
               ∇hₘₙ(Q) = ∇eₘ(Q) - ∇eₙ(Q).

  By construction, Q ∈ 𝕊ₘₙ if and only if hₘₙ(Q) = 0. In other words, 𝕊ₘₙ is
  the zero level set of hₘₙ. It follows that, for Q ∈ 𝕊ₘₙ, ∇hₘₙ(Q) is
  orthogonal to the surface 𝕊ₘₙ at Q in the direction of increasing eₘ - eₙ.
  <!-- Note from PR discussion
    1. `∇hₘₙ` *is* a well-behaved vector (subject to some assumptions -- see
        below).
    2. The contact surface "clips" intersecting geometries M and N into disjoint
       geometries M' and N'. `∇hₘₙ` points *out* of M' and *into* N'.
    Assumptions:
    - `∇e` is differentiable and "points outward"

   TODO(DamrongGuoy):
   1. Document the above listed properties of `∇hₘₙ`.
   2. Add a todo indicating M' and N' should be illustrated in the docs.
   3. Explicitly add the assumptions on `e` that make this interpretation valid.
  -->

  Notice that the domain of eₘₙ is the two-dimensional surface 𝕊ₘₙ, while the
  domain of ∇hₘₙ is the three-dimensional compact set 𝕄 ∩ ℕ.
  Even though eₘₙ and ∇hₘₙ are defined on different domains (𝕊ₘₙ and 𝕄 ∩ ℕ),
  our implementation only represents them on their common domain, i.e., 𝕊ₘₙ.

  <h2> Discrete Representation </h2>

  In practice, hydroelastic geometries themselves have a discrete
  representation: either a triangular surface mesh for rigid geometries or a
  tetrahedral volume mesh for compliant geometry. This discretization leads to
  contact surfaces that are likewise discrete.

  Intersection between triangles and tetrahedra (or tetrahedra and tetrahedra)
  can produce polygons with up to eight sides. A %ContactSurface can represent
  the resulting surface as a mesh of such polygons, or as a mesh of tesselated
  triangles. The domains of the two representations are identical. The
  triangular version admits for simple, high-order integration over the domain.
  Every element is a triangle, and triangles will only disappear and reappear
  as their areas go to zero. However, this increases the total number of
  faces in the mesh by more than a factor of three over the polygonal mesh. The
  polygonal representation produces fewer faces, but high order integration over
  polygons is problematic. We recommend choosing the cheapest representation
  that nevertheless supports your required fidelity (see
  QueryObject::ComputeContactSurfaces()).

  The representation of any %ContactSurface instance can be reported by calling
  representation(). If it returns HydroelasticContactRepresentation::kTriangle,
  then the mesh and pressure field can be accessed via tri_mesh_W() and
  tri_e_MN(), respectively. If it returns
  HydroelasticContactRepresentation::kPolygon, then use poly_mesh_W() and
  poly_e_MN().

  Regardless of representation (polygon or triangle), the normal for each
  mesh face is guaranteed to point "out of" N and "into" M. They can be accessed
  via the mesh, e.g., `tri_mesh_W().face_normal(face_index)`. By definition,
  the normals of the mesh are discontinuous at triangle boundaries.

  The pressure values on the contact surface are represented as a continuous,
  piecewise-linear function, accessed via tri_e_MN() or poly_e_MN().

  When available, the values of ∇eₘ and ∇eₙ are represented as a discontinuous,
  piecewise-constant function over the faces -- one gradient vector per face.
  These quantities are accessed via EvaluateGradE_M_W() and EvaluateGradE_N_W(),
  respectively.

  <h2> Barycentric Coordinates </h2>

  For Point Q on the surface mesh of the contact surface between Geometry M and
  Geometry N, r_WQ = (x,y,z) is the displacement vector from the origin of the
  world frame to Q expressed in the coordinate frame of W. We also have the
  _barycentric coordinates_ (b0, b1, b2) on a triangle of the surface mesh that
  contains Q. With vertices of the triangle labeled as v₀, v₁, v₂, we can
  map (b0, b1, b2) to r_WQ by:

               r_WQ = b0 * r_Wv₀ + b1 * r_Wv₁ + b2 * r_Wv₂,
               b0 + b1 + b2 = 1, bᵢ ∈ [0,1],

  where r_Wvᵢ is the displacement vector of the vertex labeled as vᵢ from the
  origin of the world frame, expressed in the world frame.

  We use the barycentric coordinates to evaluate the field values.

   field representation, and (optional) gradients of the contacting geometries'
   pressure fields.

   @param grad_eM_W    ∇eₘ sampled once per face, expressed in the world frame.

   @pre The face normals in `mesh_W` point *out of* geometry N and *into* M.
