/** The data for reporting the signed distance between two geometries, A and B.
 It provides the id's of the two geometries, the witness points Ca and Cb on
 the surfaces of A and B, the signed distance, and nhat_BA_W a direction of
 fastest increasing distance (always unit length and always point outward
 from B's surface).

 - When A and B are separated, distance > 0.
 - When A and B are touching or penetrating, distance <= 0.
 - By definition, nhat_AB_W must be in the opposite direction of nhat_BA_W.
 - (p_WCa - p_Wcb) = distance Â· nhat_BA_W.
 - In some cases, nhat_BA_W is not unique, and is_nhat_BA_W_unique is false.
 @warning For two geometries that are just touching, the underlying code can
          guarantee a correct value for nhat_BA_W only when one geometry is a
          sphere, and the other geometry is a sphere, a box, or a cylinder.
          Otherwise, the underlying code is not in place yet to guarantee a
          correct value for nhat_BA_W when surfaces are just touching, and the
          vector will be populated by NaN values.
 @tparam T The underlying scalar type. Must be a valid Eigen scalar.
