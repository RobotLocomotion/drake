# File: bad_geometry_volume_negative.obj
# The geometry in this file does not describe a closed triangular mesh (it only
# has ONE face) and Drake's mass properties calculator produces an invalid
# volume, invalid mass, invalid center of mass, and invalid inertia matrix.
# An additional defect (which makes invalidity easier to detect) is that its one
# face has a winding (order of its vertices) that results in Drake calculating
# a negative volume for this mesh (volume = -1.0).

# The 3 vertices below together with the origin (0, 0, 0) form a tetrahedron.
# Drake happens to use this single tetrahedron to calculate volume and other
# mass proeprties. However, this mesh only has ONE face, so its bounding box
# indicates a volume = 0, which is another way to detect mesh defects.

# This mesh's single face has a bad winding (normal points inward, not outward).
