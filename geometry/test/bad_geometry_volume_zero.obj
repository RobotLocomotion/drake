# A simple mesh that reports zero volume in CalcSpatialInertia().
# The mesh was initially provided by a user in issue #21924.
# It leads to zero volume because several faces have the incorrect vertex
# ordering (winding). (The faces have been re-ordered relative to the issue to
# admit distinguishing good and bad faces.)
