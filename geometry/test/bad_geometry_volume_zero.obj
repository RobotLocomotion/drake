# File: bad_geometry_volume_zero.obj
# The geometry in this file produces invalid mass and inertia properties
# due to improper winding (order of the vertices) in some of its faces.
# This file has the same vertices as the file bad_geometry_corrected.obj,
# but some of this file's faces have disordered vertices which produce a mesh
# with zero volume (volume = 0) and invalid centroid and spatial inertia.
