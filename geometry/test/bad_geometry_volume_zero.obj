# File: bad_geometry_volume_zero.obj
# The geometry in this file produces invalid mass and inertia properties
# due to improper winding (order of the vertices) in some of its faces.
# This file has the same vertices as the file bad_geometry_corrected.obj.
# However this file's faces have disordered vertices which produce a mesh
# with zero volume (volume = 0) and an invalid centroid and spatial inertia.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file uses the data in the original bad mesh file submitted by the Drake
# user in issue #21924 [github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/21924]. This
# issue was resolved in PR #21929 [github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/pull/21929]
# by creating a more coherent error message when the volume calculated from
# geometry in an .obj file is not reasonably positive.
