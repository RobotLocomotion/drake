# File: bad_geometry_corrected.obj
# The geometry in this file produces valid mass and inertia properties
# due to proper winding (order of the vertices) in all of its faces.
# This file has the same vertices as the file bad_geometry_volume_zero.obj.
# However this file's faces were ordered to produce a valid mesh with a
# positive volume (volume = +0.5) and a valid centroid and spatial inertia.
# Related: issue #21924 [github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/21924].
