"""Conducts integration tests by exercising the entire RPC pipeline that
contains a render client and a render server.  The tests then inspect the
generated images or glTF files by comparing them with the expected output.

As different renderers may have various rounding errors or subtle lighting
settings, two heuristic thresholds are applied, i.e., a per-pixel threshold for
each image type and an overall percentage threshold for invalid pixels.

Two images are considered close enough if the majority of the pixels are within
the per-pixel threshold.  The ground truth images are generated by
RenderEngineVtk.

For glTF comparison, the generated glTFs are compared against a carefully
inspected ground truth glTF file.  Some entries not in the scope of the glTF
test are replaced with placeholders to make the file size minimal.

See `Testing of the client-server RPC pipeline` section in the README file for
more information.
