/** SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based
 operations) in a Diagram. Through SceneGraph, other systems that introduce
 geometry can _register_ that geometry as part of a common global domain,
 including it in geometric queries (e.g., cars controlled by one LeafSystem can
 be observed by a different sensor system). SceneGraph provides the
 interface for registering the geometry, updating its position based on the
 current context, and performing geometric queries.

 Only registered "geometry sources" can introduce geometry into %SceneGraph.
 Geometry sources will typically be other leaf systems, but, in the case of
 _anchored_ (i.e., stationary) geometry, it could also be some other block of
 code (e.g., adding a common ground plane with which all systems' geometries
 interact). For dynamic geometry (geometry whose pose depends on a Context), the
 geometry source must also provide pose values for all of the geometries the
 source owns, via a port connection on %SceneGraph.

 The basic workflow for interacting with %SceneGraph is:
   - Register as a geometry source, acquiring a unique SourceId.
   - Register geometry (anchored and dynamic) with the system.
   - Connect source's geometry output ports to the corresponding %SceneGraph
     input ports.
     - Implement appropriate `Calc*` methods on the geometry output ports to
       update geometry pose values.

 @section geom_sys_inputs Inputs
 @cond
 In future versions, this will *also* include velocity and (possibly)
 acceleration ports.
 // TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI): Modify this to reflect the number of actual port
 // types.
 @endcond

 For each registered geometry source, there is one input port for each
 order of kinematics values (e.g., pose, velocity, and acceleration).
 If a source registers a frame, it must connect to these ports (although, in the
 current version, only pose is supported). Failure to connect to the port (or
 to provide valid kinematics values) will lead to runtime exceptions.

 __pose port__: An abstract-valued port providing an instance of
 FramePoseVector. For each registered frame, this "pose vector" maps the
 registered FrameId to a pose value. All registered frames must be accounted
 for and only frames registered by a source can be included in its output port.
 See the details in FrameKinematicsVector for details on how to allocate and
 calculate this port.

 @section geom_sys_outputs Outputs

 %SceneGraph has two output ports:

 __query port__: An abstract-valued port containing an instance of QueryObject.
 It provides a "ticket" for downstream LeafSystem instances to perform geometric
 queries on the %SceneGraph. To perform geometric queries, downstream
 LeafSystem instances acquire the QueryObject from %SceneGraph's output port
 and provide it as a parameter to one of %SceneGraph's query methods (e.g.,
 SceneGraph::ComputeContact()). This assumes that the querying system has
 access to a const pointer to the connected %SceneGraph instance. Use
 get_query_output_port() to acquire the output port for the query handle.

 __lcm visualization port__: An abstract-valued port containing an instance of
 PoseBundle. This is a convenience port designed to feed LCM update messages to
 drake_visualizer for the purpose of visualizing the state of the world's
 geometry. Additional uses of this port are strongly discouraged; instead, use
 an appropriate geometric query to obtain the state of the world's geometry.

 @section geom_sys_workflow Working with SceneGraph

 LeafSystem instances can relate to SceneGraph in one of two ways: as a
 _consumer_ that performs queries, or as a _producer_ that introduces geometry
 into the shared world and defines its context-dependent kinematics values.
 It is reasonable for systems to perform either role singly, or both.

 __Consumer__

 Consumers perform geometric queries upon the world geometry. %SceneGraph
 _serves_ those queries. As indicated above, in order for a LeafSystem to act
 as a consumer, it must:
   1. define a QueryObject-valued input port and connect it to %SceneGraph's
   corresponding output port, and
   2. have a reference to the connected %SceneGraph instance.

 With those two requirements satisfied, a LeafSystem can perform geometry
 queries by:
   1. evaluating the QueryObject input port, and
   2. passing the returned query object into the appropriate query method on
   SceneGraph (e.g., SceneGraph::ComputeContact()).

 __Producer__

 All producers introduce geometry into the shared geometric world. This is
 called _registering_ geometry. Depending on what exactly has been registered,
 a producer may also have to _update kinematics_. Producers themselves must be
 registered with %SceneGraph as producers (a.k.a. _geometry sources_). They
 do this by acquiring a SourceId (via SceneGraph::RegisterSource()). The
 SourceId serves as a unique handle through which the producer's identity is
 validated and its ownership of its registered geometry is maintained.

 _Registering Geometry_

 %SceneGraph cannot know what geometry _should_ be part of the shared world.
 Other systems are responsible for introducing geometry into the world. This
 process (defining geometry and informing %SceneGraph) is called
 _registering_ the geometry. The source that registers the geometry "owns" the
 geometry; the source's unique SourceId is required to perform any operations
 on the geometry registered with that SourceId. Geometry can be registered as
 _anchored_ or _dynamic_.

 Dynamic geometry can move; more specifically, its kinematics (e.g., pose)
 depends on a system's Context. Particularly, dynamic geometry is
 _fixed_ to a _frame_ whose kinematics values depend on a context. As the frame
 moves, the geometries fixed to it move with it. Therefore, to register dynamic
 geometry a frame must be registered first. These registered frames serve as the
 basis for repositioning geometry in the shared world. The geometry source is
 responsible for providing up-to-date kinematics values for those registered
 frames upon request (via an appropriate output port on the source LeafSystem
 connecting to the appropriate input port on %SceneGraph). The work flow is
 as follows:
   1. A LeafSystem registers itself as a geometry source, acquiring a SourceId
      (RegisterSource()).
   2. The source registers a frame (GeometrySource::RegisterFrame()).
     - A frame always has a "parent" frame. It can implicitly be the world
     frame, _or_ another frame registered by the source.
   3. Register one or more geometries to a frame
   (GeometrySource::RegisterGeometry()).
     - The registered geometry is posed relative to the frame to which it is
     fixed.
     - The geometry can also be posed relative to another registered geometry.
     It will be affixed to _that_ geometry's frame.

 Anchored geometry is _independent_ of the context (i.e., it doesn't move).
 Anchored geometries are always affixed to the immobile world frame. As such,
 registering a frame is _not_ required for registering anchored geometry
 (see GeometrySource::RegisterAnchoredGeometry()). However, the source still
 "owns" the anchored geometry.

 _Updating Kinematics_

 Registering _dynamic_ geometry implies a contract between the geometry source
 and %SceneGraph. The geometry source must do the following:
   - It must provide, populate, and connect two output ports: the "id" port and
   the "pose" port.
   - The id port must contain _all_ the frame ids returned as a result of frame
   registration.
   - The pose port must contain one pose per registered frame; the pose value is
   expressed relative to the registered frame's _parent_ frame. As mentioned
   above, the iᵗʰ pose value should describe the frame indicated by the iᵗʰ id
   in the id output port.

 Failure to meet these requirements will lead to a run-time error.

  /** @name             Topology Manipulation
   Topology manipulation consists of changing the data contained in the world.
   This includes registering a new geometry source, adding or
   removing frames, and adding or removing geometries.

   Currently, the topology can only be manipulated during initialization.
   Eventually, the API will expand to include modifications of the topology
   during discrete updates.

   The initialization phase begins with the instantiation of a %SceneGraph
   and ends when a context is allocated by the %SceneGraph instance. This is
   the only phase when geometry sources can be registered with %SceneGraph.
   Once a source is registered, it can register frames and geometries. Any
   frames and geometries registered during this phase become part of the
   _default_ context state for %SceneGraph and calls to
   CreateDefaultContext() will produce identical contexts.

   Every geometry must ultimately be associated with a parent frame.
   The position of every geometry in the world depends on a hierarchy of frames
   between it and the world. The pose of a geometry is described relative
   to its parent (a frame or another geometry). That parent may, in turn, also
   have a parent. So, the position of a particular geometry in the world frame
   depends on all of its ancestors which lie between it and the world frame. The
   act of assigning a frame or geometry as a child to another frame or geometry
   (as appropriate) and defining its pose, is referred to colloquially has
   "hanging" it on the parent.

   Geometry sources can only hang frames or geometries onto other frames and/or
   geometries that it "owns".
