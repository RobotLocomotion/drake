/** SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based
 operations) in a Diagram. Through SceneGraph, other systems that introduce
 geometry can _register_ that geometry as part of a common global domain,
 including it in geometric queries (e.g., cars controlled by one LeafSystem can
 be observed by a different sensor system). SceneGraph provides the
 interface for registering the geometry, updating its position based on the
 current context, and performing geometric queries.

 @system
 name: SceneGraph
 input_ports:
 - <em style="color:gray">(source name)</em>_pose
 - <em style="color:gray">(source name)</em>_configuration
 output_ports:
 - query
 @endsystem

 For each registered "geometry source", there is an input port whose name begins
 with <em style="color:gray">(source name)</em>.


 Only registered "geometry sources" can introduce geometry into %SceneGraph.
 Geometry sources will typically be other leaf systems, but, in the case of
 _anchored_ (i.e., stationary) geometry, it could also be some other block of
 code (e.g., adding a common ground plane with which all systems' geometries
 interact). For dynamic geometry (geometry whose pose depends on a Context), the
 geometry source must also provide pose/configuration values for all of the
 geometries the source owns, via a port connection on %SceneGraph. For N
 geometry sources, the %SceneGraph instance will have N pose/configuration input
 ports.

 The basic workflow for interacting with %SceneGraph is:

 - Register as a geometry source, acquiring a unique SourceId.
 - Register geometry (anchored and dynamic) with the system.
 - Connect source's geometry output ports to the corresponding %SceneGraph
   input ports.
   - Implement appropriate `Calc*` methods on the geometry output ports to
     update geometry pose/configuration values.

 @section geom_sys_inputs Inputs
 @cond
 In future versions, this will *also* include velocity and (possibly)
 acceleration ports.
 // TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI): Modify this to reflect the number of actual port
 // types.
 @endcond

 For each registered geometry source, there is one input port for each order
 of kinematics values (e.g., pose, velocity, acceleration, and configuration).
 If a source registers a frame or a deformable geometry, it must connect to the
 corresponding ports. Failure to connect to the ports (or to provide valid
 kinematics values) will lead to runtime exceptions.

 __pose port__: An abstract-valued port providing an instance of
 FramePoseVector. For each registered frame, this "pose vector" maps the
 registered FrameId to a pose value. All registered frames must be accounted
 for and only frames registered by a source can be included in its output port.
 See the details in KinematicsVector for details on how to provide values for
 this port.

 <!-- TODO(xuchenhan-tri): Consider adding some clarification about
  "configuration" as in "deformable vertex positions" compared to
  "configuration" as in articulated rigid-body configurations (and that we use
  the word to exclusively mean the former in SceneGraph). -->
 __configuration port__: An abstract-valued port providing an instance of
 GeometryConfigurationVector. For each registered deformable geometry, this
 "configuration vector" maps the registered GeometryId to its world space
 configuration (i.e. the vertex positions of its mesh representation in the
 world frame). All registered deformable geometries must be accounted for and
 only geometries registered by a source can be included in its output port.

 @section geom_sys_outputs Outputs

 %SceneGraph has two output ports:

 __query port__: An abstract-valued port containing an instance of QueryObject.
 It provides a "ticket" for downstream LeafSystem instances to perform geometric
 queries on the %SceneGraph. To perform geometric queries, downstream
 LeafSystem instances acquire the QueryObject from %SceneGraph's output port
 and provide it as a parameter to one of %SceneGraph's query methods (e.g.,
 SceneGraph::ComputeContact()). This assumes that the querying system has
 access to a const pointer to the connected %SceneGraph instance. Use
 get_query_output_port() to acquire the output port for the query handle.

 @section geom_sys_workflow Working with SceneGraph

 LeafSystem instances can relate to SceneGraph in one of two ways: as a
 _consumer_ that performs queries, or as a _producer_ that introduces geometry
 into the shared world and defines its context-dependent kinematics values.
 It is reasonable for systems to perform either role singly, or both.

 __Consumer__

 Consumers perform geometric queries upon the world geometry. %SceneGraph
 _serves_ those queries. As indicated above, in order for a LeafSystem to act
 as a consumer, it must:
   1. define a QueryObject-valued input port and connect it to %SceneGraph's
   corresponding output port, and
   2. have a reference to the connected %SceneGraph instance.

 With those two requirements satisfied, a LeafSystem can perform geometry
 queries by:
   1. evaluating the QueryObject input port, and
   2. passing the returned query object into the appropriate query method on
   SceneGraph (e.g., SceneGraph::ComputeContact()).

 __Producer__

 All producers introduce geometry into the shared geometric world. This is
 called _registering_ geometry. Depending on what exactly has been registered,
 a producer may also have to _update kinematics_. Producers themselves must be
 registered with %SceneGraph as producers (a.k.a. _geometry sources_). They
 do this by acquiring a SourceId (via SceneGraph::RegisterSource()). The
 SourceId serves as a unique handle through which the producer's identity is
 validated.

 _Registering Geometry_

 %SceneGraph cannot know what geometry _should_ be part of the shared world.
 Other systems are responsible for introducing geometry into the world. This
 process (defining geometry and informing %SceneGraph) is called
 _registering_ the geometry. Geometry can be registered as  _anchored_ or
 _dynamic_, and is always registered to (associated with) a SourceId.

 Dynamic geometry can move; more specifically, its kinematics (e.g., pose)
 depends on a system's Context. Particularly, a non-deformable dynamic geometry
 is _fixed_ to a _frame_ whose kinematics values depend on a context. As the
 frame moves, the geometries fixed to it move with it. On the other hand, a
 deformable dynamic geometry has a mesh representation whose vertices' positions
 can change and are expressed in the frame it is registered in. Therefore, to
 register dynamic geometry a frame must be registered first. These registered
 frames serve as the basis for repositioning geometry in the shared world. The
 geometry source is responsible for providing up-to-date kinematics values for
 those registered frames upon request (via an appropriate output port on the
 source LeafSystem connecting to the appropriate input port on %SceneGraph). The
 geometry source that registers deformable geometry is also responsible to
 provide the positions of the mesh vertices of the deformable geometry in the
 registered-in frame. The work flow is as follows:
   1. A LeafSystem registers itself as a geometry source, acquiring a SourceId
      (RegisterSource()).
   2. The source registers a frame (GeometrySource::RegisterFrame()).
     - A frame always has a "parent" frame. It can implicitly be the world
     frame, _or_ another frame registered by the source.
   3. Register one or more non-deformable geometries to a frame
      (RegisterGeometry()), and/or one or more deformable geometries to a frame
      (RegisterDeformableGeometry()).
     - A non-deformable geometry's pose is relative to the frame to which the
     geometry is fixed. For deformable geometries, the positions of their mesh
     vertices are expressed in the registered-in frame.
     - Rigid geometries can also be posed relative to another registered
     geometry. It will be affixed to _that_ geometry's frame.

 Anchored geometry is _independent_ of the context (i.e., it doesn't move).
 Anchored geometries are always affixed to the immobile world frame. As such,
 registering a frame is _not_ required for registering anchored geometry
 (see GeometrySource::RegisterAnchoredGeometry()). However, the source still
 "owns" the anchored geometry.

 _Updating Kinematics_

 Registering _dynamic_ non-deformable geometry implies a contract between the
 geometry source and %SceneGraph. The geometry source must do the following:
   - It must provide, populate, and connect two output ports: the "id" port and
   the "pose" port.
   - The id port must contain _all_ the frame ids returned as a result of frame
   registration.
   - The pose port must contain one pose per registered frame; the pose value is
   expressed relative to the registered frame's _parent_ frame. As mentioned
   above, the iᵗʰ pose value should describe the frame indicated by the iᵗʰ id
   in the id output port.

 Similarly, if it registers deformable geometries, the geometry source must
 provide, populate, and connect the "configuration" port. The configuration
 port must contain a vector of vertex positions per registered deformable
 geometry.

 Failure to meet these requirements will lead to a run-time error.

 @section geom_model_vs_context Model versus Context

 Many (and eventually all) methods that configure the population of SceneGraph
 have two variants that differ by whether they accept a mutable Context or not.
 When no Context is provided, _this_ %SceneGraph instance's underlying model is
 modified. When the %SceneGraph instance allocates a context, its model is
 copied into that context.

 The second variant causes %SceneGraph to modify the data stored in the provided
 Context to be modified _instead of the internal model_.

 The two interfaces _can_ be used interchangeably. However, modifications to
 `this` %SceneGraph's underlying model will _not_ affect previously allocated
 Context instances. A new Context should be allocated after modifying the
 model.

 @note In this initial version, the only methods with the Context-modifying
 variant are those methods that _do not_ change the semantics of the input or
 output ports. Modifications that make such changes must be coordinated across
 systems.
 <!-- TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI): Add context-modifying variants of all methods. -->

@section  scene_graph_versioning Detecting changes

 <!-- TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI) All references to APIs that modify versions should
  have cross links back to this section.  -->

 The geometry data associated with %SceneGraph is coarsely versioned. Consumers
 of the geometry can query for the version of the data and recognize if the
 data has been modified since last examined.

 The versioning is associated with geometry roles: proximity, illustration, and
 perception; each role has its own, independent version. Any operation
 that affects geometry with one of those roles will modify the corresponding
 version. For example:

 In C++:
 @code
 // Does *not* modify any version; no roles have been assigned.
 const GeometryId geometry_id = scene_graph.RegisterGeometry(
     source_id, frame_id, make_unique<GeometryInstance>(...));
 // Modifies the proximity version.
 scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, ProximityProperties());
 // Modifies the illustration version.
 scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, IllustrationProperties());
 // Modifies the perception version if there exists a renderer that accepts the
 // geometry.
 scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, PerceptionProperties());
 // Modifies the illustration version.
 scene_graph.RemoveRole(source_id, geometry_id, Role::kIllustration);
 // Modifies proximity version and perception version if the geometry is
 // registered with any renderer.
 scene_graph.RemoveGeometry(source_id, geometry_id);
 @endcode

 In Python:
 @python_details_begin
 @code{.py}
 # Does *not* modify any version; no roles have been assigned.
 geometry_id = scene_graph.RegisterGeometry(
     source_id, frame_id, GeometryInstance(...))
 # Modifies the proximity version.
 scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, ProximityProperties())
 # Modifies the illustration version.
 scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, IllustrationProperties())
 # Modifies the perception version if there exists a renderer that accepts the
 # geometry.
 scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, PerceptionProperties())
 # Modifies the illustration version.
 scene_graph.RemoveRole(source_id, geometry_id, Role.kIllustration)
 # Modifies proximity version and perception version if the geometry is
 # registered with any renderer.
 scene_graph.RemoveGeometry(source_id, geometry_id)
 @endcode
 @python_details_end

 Each copy of geometry data maintains its own set of versions.
 %SceneGraph's model has its own version, and that version is the same as the
 version in the Context provided by SceneGraph::CreateDefaultContext().
 Modifications to the geometry data contained in a Context modifies *that*
 data's version, but the original model data's version is unmodified,
 reflecting the unchanged model data.

 The geometry data's version is accessed via a SceneGraphInspector instance.
 model_inspector() will give access to %SceneGraph's model version. And
 QueryObject::inspector() will give access to the geometry data stored in a
 Context.

 Current versions can be compared against previously examined versions. If
 the versions match, then the geometry data is guaranteed to be the same.
 If they don't match, that indicates that the two sets of data underwent
 different revision processes. That, however, doesn't necessarily imply that the
 two sets of data are distinct. In other words, the versioning will report
 a difference unless it can guarantee equivalence.

 It is possible that two different contexts have different versions and a
 downstream system can be evaluated with each context alternatingly. If the
 system behavior depends on the geometry version, this will cause it to thrash
 whatever components depends on geometry version. The system should *clearly*
 document this fact.

  /** @name             Topology Manipulation
   Topology manipulation consists of changing the data contained in the world.
   This includes registering a new geometry source, adding frames, adding or
   removing geometries, modifying geometry properties, etc.

   The work flow for adding geometry to the SceneGraph is as follows:

   - A geometry source registers itself with %SceneGraph (via RegisterSource()).
   - The geometry source can then immediately register "anchored" geometry --
     geometry that is affixed to the world frame. These geometries will never
     move.
   - For non-deformable geometries that need to move based on the source's
     state, the geometry source must first register a GeometryFrame. In fact,
     non-deformable geometries never move directly; it is the frames to which
     they are affixed that move. A geometry source can register a frame via the
     RegisterFrame() methods.
   - Once a frame has been registered, the geometry source can register
     geometries that are rigidly affixed to that frame (or, figuratively
     speaking, "hung" on that frame). The geometry is immovably posed in that
     frame and assigned various properties. The geometry is registered via calls
     to the RegisterGeometry() methods.
   - (Experimental): Deformable geometries differ from non-deformable geometries
     in that it must have a meshed representation, and the vertices of the mesh
     can be moved in the frame the geometry is registered-in. Deformable
     geometries can be registered via calls to the (experimental)
     RegisterDeformableGeometry() methods.

   %SceneGraph has a concept of "ownership" that is separate from the C++ notion
   of ownership. All methods that *change* the world require passing the
   SourceId that was originally used to register that geometry. However,
   read-only operations on geometries do not require the SourceId, e.g., queries
   will return GeometryId values that span all sources and the properties of the
   associated geometries can be queried by arbitrary sources.

   registration yet, as these methods modify the port semantics.  */

  /** @name     Managing geometry roles

   Geometries _must_ be assigned one or more *roles* before they have an effect
   on SceneGraph computations (see @ref geometry_roles for details). These
   methods provide the ability to manage roles for a registered geometry.

   The `AssignRole()` methods provide the mechanism for initially assigning a
   role (via its corresponding properties) and, subsequently, modifying those
   properties.

   <h4>Assigning roles for the first time</h4>

   If a geometry has not had a particular role assigned to it, the role is
   assigned by the following call:

   @code
   scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, properties);
   @endcode

   The role is inferred by the type of properties provided. An exception will
   be thrown if the geometry has already had the implied role assigned to it.

   <h4>Changing the properties for an assigned role</h4>

   If the geometry has previously been assigned a role, the properties for
   that role can be modified with the following code (using ProximityProperties
   as an example):

   @code
   ProximityProperties props;
   props.AddProperty(....);  // Populate the properties.
   scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, props, RoleAssign::kReplace);
   @endcode

   An exception will be thrown if the geometry _has not_ already had a role
   assigned.

   If the goal is to modify the properties that have already been assigned, we
   recommend the following (again, using ProximityProperties as an example):

   @code
   const ProximityProperties* old_props =
       scene_graph.model_inspector().GetProximityProperties(geometry_id);
   DRAKE_DEMAND(old_props != nullptr);
   ProximityProperties new_props(*old_props);
   // Add a new property.
   new_props.AddProperty("group", "new_prop_name", some_value);
   // Remove a property previously assigned.
   new_props.RemoveProperty("old_group", "old_name_1");
   // Update the *value* of an existing property (but enforce same type).
   new_props.UpdateProperty("old_group", "old_name_2", new_value);
   scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, new_props,
                          RoleAssign::kReplace);
   @endcode

   Calling `AssignRole()` with an empty set of properties will *not* remove the
   role; it will simply eliminate possibly necessary properties. To remove
   the role completely, call `RemoveRole()`.

   @warning Currently, only __proximity__ and __illustration__ properties can be
   updated via this mechanism. Updating illustration properties has limitations
   (see @ref AssignRole(SourceId,GeometryId,IllustrationProperties,RoleAssign)
   "AssignRole(..., IllustrationProperties)" below). Attempting to update
   perception will throw an exception (to be implemented in the near future).

   All invocations of `AssignRole()` will throw an exception if:

     - the source id is invalid.
     - the geometry id is invalid.
     - the geometry id is not owned by the given source id.
     - Another geometry with the same name, affixed to the same frame, already
       has the role.

   <h4>Removing roles</h4>

   Calling `RemoveRole()` will remove the properties and _role_ entirely.

   These methods include the model- and context-modifying variants.    */

   @anchor scene_graph_collision_filter_manager

   Control over "collision filtering" is handled by the CollisionFilterManager.
   %SceneGraph provides access to the manager. As with other geometry data,
   collision filters can be configured in %SceneGraph's *model* or in the copy
   stored in a particular Context. These methods provide access to the manager
   for the data stored in either location.

   %SceneGraph implicitly filters collisions between rigid geometries affixed to
   the same frame. This allows representation of complex shapes by providing a
   union of simpler shapes without producing spurious collisions between those
   overlapping shapes. %SceneGraph doesn't create *any* collision filters for
   deformable geometries automatically. Users can add filters to deformable
   geometries as they require after registration.

   Generally, it should be considered a bad practice to hang onto the instance
   of CollisionFilterManager returned by collision_filter_manager(). It is not
   immediately clear whether a particular CollisionFilterManager instance
   refers to the %SceneGraph model or the Context data and persisting the
   reference may lead to confusion. Keeping the reference for the duration of
   a function is appropriate, but allowing it to persist outside of the scope
   of acquisition is dangerous. Acquiring a new CollisionFilterManager is *very*
   cheap, so feel free to discard and reacquire.

   Simply acquiring an instance of CollisionFilterManager will advance the
   @ref scene_graph_versioning "proximity version" for the related geometry
   data (model or context).

   @note %SceneGraph does not track topology or semantic information of models,
   so decisions about *what* to filter belong in software layers that have the
   necessary information. For example, some automatic filtering is done in
   @ref mbp_finalize_stage "MultibodyPlant::Finalize()". Applications may
   need to add more filtering or adjust filters during simulation.
