/** Class for articulating changes to the configuration of SceneGraph's
 "collision filters"; collision filters limit the scope of various proximity
 queries.

 This class provides the basis for *declaring* what pairs should or should not
 be included in the set of proximity query candidates C (see documentation for
 CollisionFilterManager for details on the set C).

 A declaration consists of zero or more *statements*. Each statement can
 declare, for example, that the pair (g₁, g₂) should be excluded from C (also
 known as "filtering the pair"). That statement is added to the declaration by
 invoking the corresponding statement method (see below), and the result of the
 invocation, is that the statement is appended to the declaration.

 Each statement method returns a reference to the declaration instance, so a
 number of statements can be chained together, i.e.,

 ```
 collision_filter_manager.Apply(
   CollisionFilterDeclaration()
       .ExcludeWithin(some_geometry_set)
       .ExcludeBetween(set_A, set_B));
 ```

 It's worth noting, that the statements are evaluated in *invocation* order such
 that a later statement can partially or completely undo the effect of an
 earlier statement. The full declaration is evaluated by
 CollisionFilterManager::Apply(). */

   These methods provide mechanisms which implicitly define a set of pairs and

   documentation for CollisionFilterManager for definition of set C). Each
   method provides the definition for the set of pairs.

   SceneGraph maintains some invariants about pairs which will never be
   considered in proximity queries (the sets `Aₚ × Aₚ`, `Fₚ`, or `Iₚ` -- again
   see CollisionFilterManager for explanation of those sets). If any pair in
   those sets are included in declarations which allow collisions, those pairs
   will simply be ignored.

   The *declared* pairs can be invalid (e.g., containing GeometryId values that
   aren't part of the SceneGraph data). This will only be detected when applying
   the declaration (see CollisionFilterManager::Apply()).  */
