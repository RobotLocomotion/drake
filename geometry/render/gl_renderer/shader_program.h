/* TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI) This implies a compile-time shader definition. It may
 be preferred to move away from this architecture. To do runtime shader
 configuration requires careful coordination between the runtime configurable
 properties and the compile-time mechanisms. Plenty of guidance and
 documentation on what constitutes valid declarations. (I.e., you have to assume
 that vertex position is at location 0, etc.)

 Furthermore, the definition of the shader must be accompanied by consistent
 shader *meta data* which will inform the ShaderProgram class of what uniforms,
 pixel attributes, etc., are required, their types, and where they come from.
 This last -- where they come from -- is going to be compile-time constrained.
 There should be an enumerated number of quantities (of known types) that
 ShaderProgram can bind.

 Alternatively, we could ape the VTK architecture with the exception being
 that we require *declaration* of shaders (or provide automatic clustering of
 identical shaders) such that we don't have a ridiculous proliferation of
 shaders, leading to a thrashing OpenGL context. This last option has the
 benefit of providing cross-RenderEngine shader compatibility. All we need is
 the ability to manufacture a shader and can pass that into any pipeline that
 consumes glsl (and knows how to set properties/uniforms). */

/* Definition of a GLSL shader program including a vertex and fragment shader.
 All operations on this shader program require an active OpenGL context. In
 fact, they require the same context which was active when the program was
 "loaded".

 Explicit functionality is given in derived classes. They specify the actual
 shader code and any idiosyncratic details. To be compatible with *this*
 shader abstraction, a shader must meet some minimum requirements:

   - It must specify a uniform mat4 called "model_view_matrix" - this transforms
     vertices from the geometry's canonical frame G to the OpenGl camera frame
     C.
   - It must specify a uniform mat4 called "projection_matrix" - this transforms
     vertices from the geometry's canonical frame G to the OpenGl device frame
     D.  */
