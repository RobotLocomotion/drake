/* Creates an OpenGL-compatible mesh representation of a unit cylinder; its
 radius and height are equal to 1. It is centered on the origin of its canonical
 frame C and aligned with Frame C's z axis: Cz.
 The cylinder's geometry consists of the two caps and the barrel and is
 tessellated as follows. The barrel is divided in two directions: into a
 given number of _bands_ of equal height along its length, and into a given
 number of strips of equal width around its curvature. At the top and bottom
 circular caps a triangular fan is created from a vertex at the center of each
 circular cap to all of the vertices on the edge where cap and barrel meet.

 Texture coordinates are assigned akin to how they are assigned to the sphere.
 The u-values change in the radial direction while the v-values change along the
 length direction. There is a seam in the mapping along an arbitrary
 longitudinal line (u = 0 on one side and u = 1 on the other).

 This mesh's triangles will not all be topologically connected via shared
 vertices. Discontinuities in surface normals lead to disjoint meshes (i.e.,
 the caps are separate from the barrel).

 @param num_strips  The number of strips the barrel's curvature is divided into.
 @param num_bands   The number of equal-width bands spanning the height of the
                    cylinder.

 positive z-axis of Frame C.

 Texture coordinates are assigned so that the "mimimum" (smallest x- and
 y-values) map to (0, 0) and the opposite corner is (1, 1).

 `resolution`. There will be `resolution^2` square patches (each defined by

 Texture coordinates are assigned so that the texture will be fully applied to
 each face once. The +/-x and +/-y faces are all oriented so that the top of
 the texture map will be in the +z direction. For the +z and -z faces, the
 orientation is not guaranteed.

 This mesh's triangles will not all be topologically connected via shared
 vertices. Discontinuities in surface normals lead to disjoint meshes (each box
 face is disconnected).

/* Creates an OpenGL-compatible mesh representation of a capsule with the given

 frame C with its length aligned with C's z axis: Cz. The capsule is,
 conceptually, a cylinder capped with two hemispheres. The `length` is the
 measure of the cylinder's length. So, the *total* length of the capsule would
 be `length + 2 * radius`.

 Texture coordinates are assigned akin to the sphere and cylinder. The u-values
 change from 0 to 1 in the radial direction (with a seam at an arbitrary
 longitudinal line), and the v-values change from 0 to 1 from the south to the
 north poles based on fraction of the geodesic distance from pole to pole.

 The capsule is tessellated according to `samples`. The circular cross section
 of the cylindrical region of the capsule will have `samples` number of
 vertices. The two hemispherical caps will be tesselated such that triangles
 near the spherical equators have good aspect ratios. There is only a single
 band of quadrilaterals (split into pairs of triangles) in the cylindrical
 region.

 @param samples   The number of vertices to place around the barrel of the
                  capsule.
 @param radius    The radius of the hemispherical end-caps and cylindrical
