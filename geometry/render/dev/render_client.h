     The RenderCameraCore of the camera being rendered.  Its

   @param scene_path
     The path to the input scene that is being rendered.  The client will use
     the basename of the file path to construct the final output file, stored
     in its temp_directory().  For example, `/some/path/scene.gltf` would be
     saved in `{temp_directory()}/scene.gltf.png` (if the server returned a PNG
     file), regardless of whether `/some/path` is in temp_directory().  Users

     The mime type to set for the scene file being uploaded as a file.  If not
     provided, no mime type will be sent to the server.  No validity checks on
     the value of the provided mime type are performed.
