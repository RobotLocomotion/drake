   @param url
     The url of the server to communicate with, e.g., `"http://127.0.0.1"`.  May
     **not** have a trailing `/`.
   @param port
     The port to communicate with the server on, e.g., `8000`.  A value of less
     than or equal to `0` implies no port-level communication is needed.
   @param render_endpoint
     The endpoint that the server expects to receive render requests to, e.g.,
     `"render"`.  May **not** have a leading or trailing `/`, communications
     with the server are constructed as `{url}/{render_endpoint}`.

     with the server.

     Whether or not the temp_directory() should be deleted upon destruction of
     this instance.

  /* Uploads the scene file from `scene_path` to the render server, downloads
   the image file response, and returns the path to the image file.
   The returned file path may be used directly with any one of the helper
   methods LoadColorImage(), LoadDepthImage(), or LoadLabelImage().  The file
   path returned will be in temp_directory(), users do not need to delete the
   file manually after they are finished.

   @sa no_cleanup()
   @param camera_core
     The RenderCameraCore of the camera being rendered.  Its
     RenderCameraCore::intrinsics() will be communicated to the server.
   @param image_type
     The type of image being rendered.
   @param scene_path
     The path to the input scene that is being rendered.  The client will use
     the basename of the file path to construct the final output file, stored
     in its temp_directory().  For example, `/some/path/scene.gltf` would be
     saved in `{temp_directory()}/scene.gltf.png` (if the server returned a PNG
     file), regardless of whether `/some/path` is in temp_directory().  Users
     are strongly encouraged to store their scene files in temp_directory().
   @param mime_type
     The mime type to set for the scene file being uploaded as a file.  If not
     provided, no mime type will be sent to the server.  No validity checks on
     the value of the provided mime type are performed.
   @param depth_range
     When `image_type` describes a depth render, this parameter must be provided
     from the DepthRenderCamera::depth_range().  May not have a value for color
     or label image renders.
   @return
     A successful download of a rendering from the server will return the path
     to the downloaded file, which will be exactly
     `{temp_directory()}/{$(basename scene_path)} + extension`, where
     `extension` will depend on what the server returns, e.g., `.png` or
     `.tiff`.
   @throws std::runtime_error
     If a rendering cannot be obtained from the server for any reason.
   @throws std::logic_error
