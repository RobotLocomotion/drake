"""
A prototype glTF render server.  Users seeking to utilize their own renderer
as a replacement for the sample VTK based C++ executable can simply change the
implementation in the :func:`render_callback` method.  Briefly refer to the
class documentation of :class:`RenderRequest` to familiarize yourself with what
attributes are parsed and made available for you.  Then replace the
implementation of :func:`render_callback` with your own implementation to call
your renderer of choice.

The dependent package requirements for running this server::

    flask>=1.1

Tip:
    While developing your server, it can be helpful to wield the ``FLASK_ENV``
    environment variable.  Its default value is ``"production"``, but setting
    it to ``"development"`` can be helpful in iteratively developing the file.
    This environment variable is to be set **before** launching the server,
    examples can be found `in the flask documentation <flask_env_>`_.

    .. _flask_env:
        https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/config/#environment-and-debug-features

    In addition to the other benefits of a development server for testing, when
    you make changes to this file and save to disk the ``flask`` runner will
    automatically detect this and reload the server (this will not happen with
    wsgi wrappers like ``gunicorn``).

    Lastly, the server implemented here provides a brief html page rendering
    when a user issues a ``GET /`` (e.g., you visit ``localhost:8000`` in your
    browser).  When ``FLASK_ENV="development"``, this server will include the
    path to the :data:`SERVER_CACHE` so you may easily navigate there in your
    terminal if desired.  Information about the server directory structure
    should not be revealed in production.

Warning:
    There are some global variables declared below, e.g., ``RENDER_ENDPOINT``.
    It is acceptable to use simple "readonly" global variables like strings and
    booleans, but in general global variables cannot be changed or have their
    state shared between processes.  Do not attempt to overwrite their values
    during server execution -- halt the server, change the values, and restart.

    For example, avoid creating a list or dictionary at module scope and
    modifying it from within one of the methods below to save any kind state.
    This will only work in the single threaded development server provided by
    flask, but will not be coherent when using a wsgi wrapper such as
    ``gunicorn``.  If your needs require shared state between server processes,
    you will want to use a proper database or implement a scheme using
    multiprocessing.
