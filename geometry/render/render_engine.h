/** The engine for performing rasterization operations on geometry. This
 includes rgb images and depth images. The coordinate system of
 %RenderEngine's viewpoint `R` is `X-right`, `Y-down` and `Z-forward`
 with respect to the rendered images.

 <h3>Output image format</h3>

   - RGB (ImageRgba8U) : the RGB image has four channels in the following
     order: red, green, blue, and alpha. Each channel is represented by
     a uint8_t.

   - Depth (ImageDepth32F) : the depth image has a depth channel represented
     by a float. For a point in space `P`, the value stored in the depth
     channel holds *the Z-component of the position vector `p_RP`.*
     Note that this is different from the range data used by laser
     range finders (like that provided by DepthSensor) in which the depth
     value represents the distance from the sensor origin to the object's
     surface.

   - Label (ImageLabel16I) : the label image has single channel represented
     by an int16_t. The value stored in the channel holds a RenderLabel value
     which corresponds to an object class in the scene or an "empty" pixel (see
     RenderLabel for more details).

 @anchor render_engine_default_label
 <h3>RenderLabels, registering geometry, and derived classes</h3>

 By convention, when registering a geometry, the provided properties should
 contain no more than one RenderLabel instance, and that should be the
 `(label, id)` property. %RenderEngine provides the notion of a
 _default render label_ that will be applied where no `(label, id)` RenderLabel
 property is found.  This default value can be one of two values:
 RenderLabel::kDontCare or RenderLabel::kUnspecified. The choice of default
 RenderLabel can be made at construction and it affects registration behavior
 when the `(label, id)` property is absent:

   - RenderLabel::kUnspecified: throws an exception.
   - RenderLabel::kDontCare: the geometry will be included in label images as
     the generic, non-distinguishing label.

 Choosing RenderLabel::kUnspecified is best in a system that wants explicit
 feedback and strict enforcement on a policy of strict label enforcement --
 everything should receive a meaningful label. The choice of
 RenderLabel::kDontCare is best for a less strict system in which only some
 subset of geometry need be explicitly specified.

 Derived classes configure their _de facto_ default RenderLabel value, or
 a user-configured default value, at construction, subject to the requirements
 outlined above.

 Derived classes should not access the `(label, id)` property directly.
 %RenderEngine provides a method to safely extract a RenderLabel value from
 the PerceptionProperties, taking into account the configured default value and
 the documented @ref reserved_render_label "RenderLabel semantics"; see
 GetRenderLabelOrThrow().  */
