 Rendering engines are used to enable simulation of the perception stack.

 <h2>Overview</h2>

 Perception simulation is supported via the RenderEngine API. It provides the
 interface through which the geometries in the simulation can be rendered to
 three types of images: color, depth, and label. (For more details about the
 API, refer to the RenderEngine documentation.)

 Drake includes *two* implementations of that API:

   - RenderEngineVtk - A GPU-based rasterization renderer using the VTK library.
   - RenderEngineGl - A GPU-based rasterization renderer using direct calls to
                      the OpenGL API.

 These implementations differ in many ways largely differ in performance and
 flexibility potential. RenderEngineVtk is slower but has the possibility of
 leveraging the full VTK API to provide *post hoc* customizations.
 RenderEngineGl is faster, but gains that performance boost by implementing a
 barebones rendering pipeline.

 Picking the right renderer for your simulated sensors will be based on
 considering those differences and picking the trade-off that best suits your
 application.

 The current API is simple and precludes sophisticated definitions of lights
 and materials. As the API matures, these additional features will be added.

 <h2>Performance</h2>

 The performance of both of the current implementations will strongly deend
 on the quality of a system's GPU and its driver. A more powerful graphics card
 with an up-to-date driver will likely produce images more quickly.

 It is impossible to state what the a RenderEngine's performance is in absolute
 terms. Instead, Drake includes a simple @ref render_engine_benchmarks
 "benchmark" which can be run locally to assess the actual performance the end
 user will experience on a fixed system.
