  - A special key for access in some coordinated image database.
  - Contents of a known image file format.

 Note: when assigning to a %TextureSource, take *extra* care to distinguish
 between a TextureKey and a path. Simply assigning a string (or string-like
 type) will successfully compile, but the implicit conversion from those types
 to std::filesystem::path will mean you're setting a *path*. When setting a
 texture key, explicitly declare it as such. E.g.,:

 TextureSource source = TextureKey{"looks/like/a/path/but/is/not.png"};

 This can be particularly surprising if the right-hand side is a
 std::string_view. There *is* an implicit conversion from std::string_view to
 std::filesystem::path, but not to std::string. */

/* If a mesh definition doesn't include a single material (e.g., as in an .mtl
 file for an .obj mesh), this function applies a cascading priority for
 potentially defining a material. Failing everything in the priority list, it
 will return std::nullopt.

 The material is defined with the following protocol:

   - If the properties indicate a material at all, the material is derived
     purely from the properties (e.g., ("phong", "diffuse_map") and
     ("phong", "diffuse").
   - Otherwise, if an image can be located with a "compatible name" (e.g.,
     foo.png for the mesh foo.obj), a material with an unmodulated texture is
     created. An existing foo.png that can't be read or an empty `mesh_path`
     are both treated as "no compatible png could be found" and will fall
     through to the next condition. If the mesh is in-memory, there is, by
     definition, no compatible png.
   - Otherwise, if a default_diffuse value is provided, a material is created
     with the given default_diffuse color value.
   - Finally, if no material is defined, std::nullopt is returned. In such a
     case, a consumer of the returned mesh can generate its own material using
     its default diffuse color with MakeDiffuseMaterial(). Such a material would
     be compliant with the heuristic defined in @ref geometry_materials.

 References to textures will be included in the material iff they can be read
 and the `uv_state` is full. Otherwise, a warning will be dispatched.

 @pre The mesh (named by `mesh_filename`) is a valid mesh and did not have an
      acceptable material definition). */
