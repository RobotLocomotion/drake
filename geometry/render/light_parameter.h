   In the physical world, light from a point source decreases with the squared
   distance (with some linear attenuation due to atmospheric effects). However,
   this often leads to undesirable illumination effects in low-dynamic range
   rendering. Suitable values typically will temper the quadratic effects with
   non-zero constant and linear terms.

   get full illumination (surfaces closer will get *magnified* illumination.

   common to *increase* the light `intensity` to offset what would otherwise
   appear to be a rapid decay. By default, the light is unattenuated, with
   constant illumination across all distances.

   When using directional lights, attenuation is best kept with the default,
