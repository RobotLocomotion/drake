   In the picture above, each suitable triangle in N has its face normal making
   an acute angle with the pressure gradient in M, and each unsuitable triangle
   has its face normal vector making an obtuse angle with the pressure gradient.
   In this case, we can use π/2 as the angle threshold to distinguish the two
   kinds of triangles in N.
       However, there is no single angle threshold that works for all cases.
   For example, a rigid box N penetrates into a soft ball M (see the
   following picture) and has triangles on its left side and right side with
   face normals that make obtuse angles with the pressure gradient. Using
   π/2 as the threshold, we would prohibit these triangles from the contact
   surface.
