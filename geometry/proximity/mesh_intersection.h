// TODO(DamrongGuoy): Take care of double counting problem when a triangle of
//  a surface mesh overlaps a triangular face shared by two tetrahedrons of a
//  volume mesh. The fix will require several functions in the code to work
//  together. These ideas should help:
//  - Use Simulation of Simplicity with floating-point filter.
//  - Book keeping the shared faces of the tetrahedrons in the volume mesh.
//  - Require unique vertices in the surface mesh and in the volume mesh.

// TODO(DamrongGuoy): Take care of special cases when `p` lies on the
//  plane of the half space to help with the double counting problem. Right
//  now it is taken as being inside the half space.
//    Instead of fcl::Halfspace(normal, distance), we might want to specify
//  the half space using a pair (face, element), i.e., a triangular face of a
//  tetrahedral element. It will identify the half space bounded by the plane
//  of the triangular `face` that contains the tetrahedral `element`, and will
//  enable symbolic perturbation in such a way that a point `p` on a shared
//  face of two tetrahedrons will be considered inside one tetrahedron and
//  outside another tetrahedron. Right now it will be considered inside both
//  tetrahedrons.

        4-gon with two pairs of duplicate vertices.

/** Computes the contact surface between a soft geometry S and a rigid
 geometry R. This does not use any broadphase culling.
 @param[in] id_S
     Id of the soft geometry S.
 @param[in] field_S
     A scalar field defined on the soft volume mesh S. Mesh S's vertices are
     defined in S's frame. The scalar field is likewise defined in frame S
 (that is, it can only be evaluated on points which have been measured and
     expressed in frame S). For hydroelastic contact, the scalar field is a
     "pressure" field.
 @param[in] X_WS
     The pose of the rigid frame S in the world frame W.
 @param[in] id_R
     Id of the rigid geometry R.
 @param[in] mesh_R
     The rigid geometry R is represented as a surface mesh, whose vertex
     positions are in R's frame. We assume that triangles are oriented
     outward.
 @param[in] X_WR
     The pose of the rigid frame R in the world frame W.
 @return
     The contact surface between M and N. Geometries S and R map to M and N
 with a consistent mapping (as documented in ContactSurface) but without any
     guarantee as to what that mapping is. Positions of vertex coordinates are
     expressed in the world frame. The pressure distribution comes from the
 soft geometry S. The normal vector field, expressed in the world frame frame,
     comes from the rigid geometry R.
