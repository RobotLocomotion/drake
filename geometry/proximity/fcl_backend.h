/* @file
 Drake's proximity queries are written against a *backend policy*: a trait
 struct that names the third-party collision library's types and wraps the
 handful of places where libraries of this family disagree. The algorithm code
 is templated on that policy, so a single source of truth serves every backend.

 FclBackend, below, is the policy for FCL
 (https://github.com/flexible-collision-library/fcl).

 <h3>What a policy must absorb</h3>

 Drake's proximity code is being prepared to run against Coal
 (https://github.com/coal-library/coal), a descendant of FCL. The two libraries
 agree on most of the surface Drake uses -- `getNodeType()`,
 `collisionGeometry()`, `setUserData()`, `setTransform()`, `computeLocalAABB()`,
 the broadphase manager's register/update/getObjects methods, and the shapes of
 the free `collide()` and `distance()` functions are all common. They disagree
 in six places, and absorbing exactly these six is the policy's whole job:

 - D1 Shape data members are spelled differently. FCL stores a box's full
      extent in `side` and a cylinder's full length in `lz`; Coal stores
      `halfSide` and `halfLength`. Hence the static accessors (half_extents(),
      half_length(), ...) rather than direct member access at the call sites.
      Constructors, by contrast, agree, so reification needs no shim.
 - D2 Request fields diverge in both directions. FCL has
      `enable_nearest_points`, `distance_tolerance` and `gjk_solver_type`;
      Coal has `gjk_tolerance` and `collision_distance_threshold` instead.
      Hence the Configure*Request() statics.
 - D3 Contact sign convention. FCL's `Contact::penetration_depth` is a positive
      depth; Coal's is a signed distance, negative when the shapes overlap.
      Drake wants a positive overlap. Hence ContactDepth().
 - D4 Convex hull representation. FCL's `Convex` consumes Drake's
      PolygonSurfaceMesh face encoding directly; Coal's needs the faces
      fan-triangulated into `Triangle32`, and its constructor takes a different
      argument list. Hence MakeFaces()/MakeConvex().
 - D5 Broadphase callback protocol. FCL takes a function pointer plus an opaque
      `void* cdata`; Coal takes a subclass of CollisionCallBackBase /
      DistanceCallBackBase. Drake's narrowphase callbacks keep the FCL-style
      free-function signature and the Coal policy adapts them. Hence the
      Collide()/Distance() broadphase overloads.
 - D6 The NODE_TYPE enumerator sets differ. Coal adds GEOM_CONVEX16, HF_AABB
      and HF_OBBRSS, makes GEOM_CONVEX an alias for GEOM_CONVEX32, and orders
      the enumerators differently. An exhaustive switch therefore cannot be
      shared. Hence Classify(), which maps the library's node type onto the
      backend-independent ShapeKind that shared code switches on instead.

 This policy grows a member at a time as each proximity source file is
 converted to the templated form; it is deliberately not written out in full
 ahead of its users. */
