 @param[in] polygon
     The input polygon is represented by three or more ordered indices into
     `vertices_F`. This polygon is _not_ in `faces` and will not, itself, appear
     in `faces` when done.
 @param[in] n_F
     The vector that is perpendicular to the `polygon`, expressed in frame F.
 @param[in, out] faces
     New triangles are added into `faces`. Each new triangle has the same
     orientation (same normal vector) as the input polygon.
 @param[in ,out] vertices_F
     The set of vertex positions to be extended, each vertex is measured and
     expressed in frame F. It is assumed that `polygon`'s indices all reference
     vertices in this vector. One vertex will be added -- the polygon's
     centroid.
 @pre `faces` and `vertices_F` are not `nullptr`.
 @pre `polygon.size()` >= 3.
 @pre Each index in `polygon` indexes a valid vertex in `vertices_F`.
 @pre `polygon` is planar.
