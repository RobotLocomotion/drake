 geometry as well as a bit to mark whether it is anchored or dynamic.

 It stores this data by compactly "encoding" them. The encoding packs a geometry
 id value with a bit indicating if the id refers to dynamic or anchored geometry
 (proximity engine segregates them). The highest-order bit indicates dynamic (1)
 or anchored (0). The remaining lower bits store the id. The data is stored in a
