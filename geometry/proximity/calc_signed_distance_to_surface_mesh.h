/* %FeatureNormalSet provides outward normal vectors at vertices and edges of a
 triangle surface mesh. The normal at a vertex is the angle-weighted average of
 the face normals of the triangles sharing the vertex. The normal at an edge is
 the equal-weight average of the face normals of the two triangles sharing the
 edge.

 The following paper shows that normals computed in this way are most suitable
 for the inside-outside test of a point closest to a vertex or an edge.

 @param mesh_M   the surface mesh expressed in frame M.

 @param feature_normals_M  provides angle-weighted average normals at

                           edges of the surface mesh, expressed in frame M.

 @pre  The surface mesh is a closed manifold without duplicate vertices or
 self-intersection, and every triangle's face winding gives an outward-pointing
 face normal. Non-compliant meshes will introduce regions in which the query
 point will report the wrong sign (and, therefore, the wrong gradient) due to a
 misclassification of being inside or outside. This leads to discontinuities in
 the distance field across the boundaries of these regions; the distance sign
 will flip while the magnitude of the distance value is arbitrarily far away
 from zero. For open meshes, the same principle holds. The open mesh, which has
 no true concept of "inside", will nevertheless report some query points as
 being inside.

 @note If p_MQ is on the surface, the returned signed distance is zero,
 the nearest point is p_MQ itself, and the gradient is the normal
 at the vertex, edge or triangle on which p_MQ lies.

 @note If p_MQ has multiple nearest points, the returned nearest point
 and the gradient are chosen and computed from one of them. The selection
 is deterministic but arbitrary because we use the given BVH to select the
 first closest point. The search order depends on the structure of
 the BVH.

 The following table characterizes all possible cases. The sign is positive,
 negative, or zero when the query point is outside, inside, or on the
 surface respectively. The nearest point N could lie in a triangle, an edge,
 or a vertex. The gradient depends on the sign of the distance.

  |          | nearest point |                |
