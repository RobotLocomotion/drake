/* @file Detects if a tetrahedral mesh evaluates to zero signed-distance
 anywhere in its interior. A hydroelastic pressure field built
 on a mesh with this defect will have zero pressure in its interior.
 Because signed distance is defined at vertices and interpolated everywhere
 else, detection focuses on positive dimensional simplices (tetrahedra,
 triangles, edges).  A simplex is problematic, if all of its vertices lie on
 the boundary, and if the simplex intersects the mesh's interior.
 For example, a mesh with only a single tetrahedron is problematic since all its
 vertices lie on the mesh's boundary.

 A tetrahedral mesh may have other problems. For example, a tetrahedron with
 all vertices at the same distance from the boundary. A hydroelastic pressure
 field on such a tetrahedron will have zero pressure gradient. In this
 implementation, we are not detecting them yet.
