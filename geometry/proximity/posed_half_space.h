/** The definition of a half space, posed in an arbitrary frame. It is
 defined by its boundary plane such that a point's signed distance relative to
 the half space is equal to its height relative to the boundary plane (see
 Plane for details). The boundary plane's normal points outside the half space.

 The %PosedHalfSpace class is distinct from the HalfSpace class in that the
 HalfSpace class defines the half space in its own canonical frame. The posed
 half space can be defined in an arbitrary frame.

 The signed distance of a point Q can only be meaningfully evaluated if the
 point is measured and expressed in the same frame as the half space:

 ```
 const Vector3<T> nhat_F = ...;
 const Vector3<T> p_FP = ...;  // P is a point on the half space boundary.
 const PosedHalfSpace<T> half_space_F(nhat_F, p_FP);  // Half space in frame F.
 const double distance_Q = half_space_F.CalcSignedDistance(p_FQ);  // valid!
 const double distance_R = half_space_F.CalcSignedDistance(p_GR);  // invalid!
 ```
