/*
 Generates a piecewise-linear pressure field inside the given ellipsoid as
 represented by the given volume mesh. The pressure at a point is defined as
 p(x)= E⋅e(x) where e(x) = 1-‖S⁻¹⋅x‖, with the scale diagonal matrix S =
 diag({a-δ, b-δ, c-δ}) where a, b, c are the lengths of the principal semi-axes
 of `ellipsoid`, and δ is the `margin` value. The zero pressure level set of
 this field defines an ellipsoid with principal semi-axes lengths a-δ, b-δ, c-δ.
 Pressure is maximum at the center of the ellipsoid with pressure equal to E.

 @param ellipsoid        The ellipsoid with its canonical frame E.
 @param mesh_E           A pointer to a tetrahedral mesh of the ellipsoid. It
                         is aliased in the returned pressure field and must
                         remain alive as long as the field. The position
                         vectors of mesh vertices are expressed in the
                         ellipsoid's frame E.
 @param hydroelastic_modulus  Scale extent to pressure.
 @param margin           The magnitude of the margin δ.
 @return                 The pressure field defined on the tetrahedral mesh.
 @pre                    `hydroelastic_modulus` is strictly positive.
                         `mesh_E` represents the ellipsoid and has enough
                         resolution to represent the pressure field.
 @pre                    a, b, and  c are all larger than δ.
 @tparam T               The scalar type for representing the mesh
                         vertex positions and the pressure value.

  //  The current implementation uses a simple map from the ellipsoid to the
  //  unit sphere and assigns extent on the ellipsoid from the extent on the
  //  unit sphere, which is a scaled distance to boundary of the unit sphere.
  //  The current implementation has a number of limitations:
  //  1. It is not differentiable at the center of the ellipsoid.
  //  2. It is not uniformly stiff. It is stiffer along a shorter principal
  //     axis than a longer principal axis of the same ellipsoid, i.e., the
  //     gradient of pressure field is larger on the shorter principal axis.
  //  3. Implicitly we impose the rigid core as the center of the ellipsoid.
  //     In the future, we will consider a rigid core as an offset of the
  //     ellipsoid. The offset may or may not have uniform thickness from the
  //     boundary.
  //  4. We do not have a mechanism to define a pressure field using barrier
  //     functions.  One possibility is to generate the mesh in offset
  //     layers, and define linear pressure fields in each offset with
  //     different elastic modulus.
