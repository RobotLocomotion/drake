/*
 Generates a linear approximation of a pressure field inside the given box as
 represented by the given volume mesh. The pressure at a point is defined as E *
 e(x) where e ∈ [0,1] is the extent -- a measure of penetration into the volume,
 and E is the given `hydroelastic_modulus`. The extent is defined as e(x) =
 (d-δ)/(H-δ), with d the (positive) distance from point x to the nearest face on
 the box, δ the `margin` and H the minimum half size of the box. Therefore the
 zero level set of this pressure field is a distance δ within the box. The
 gradient points in the direction opposite to the normal of the nearest face to
 x and has magnitude E/(H-δ).
 @param box              The box with its canonical frame B.
 @param mesh_B           A pointer to a tetrahedral mesh of the box. It is
                         aliased in the returned pressure field and must remain
                         alive as long as the field. The position vectors of
                         mesh vertices are expressed in the box's frame B.
 @param hydroelastic_modulus  Scale extent to pressure.
 @param margin           The magnitude of the margin δ.
 @return                 The pressure field defined on the tetrahedral mesh.
 @pre                    `hydroelastic_modulus` is strictly positive.
                         `mesh_B` represents the box well (the space enclosed
                         by the mesh should be exactly the same space as the
                         box specification). `mesh_B` has enough resolution
                         to approximate the pressure field.
@pre                     The minimum half size of the box is strictly larger
                         than `margin`.
