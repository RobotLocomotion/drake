/*
 Generates a piecewise-linear pressure field inside the given sphere as
 represented by the given volume mesh. The pressure at a point with distance r
 from the origin is defined as E * e(r) where e is the extent -- a measure of
 penetration into the volume, and E is the given `hydroelastic_modulus`. The
 extent is defined as e(r) = 1 - r/ (R-δ), with R the radius of the sphere and δ
 the `margin`. Therefore the zero pressure level set of this field defines
 sphere of radius R-δ. Pressure is maximum at the center, with value E.

 @param sphere           The sphere with its canonical frame S.
 @param mesh_S           A pointer to a tetrahedral mesh of the sphere. It is
                         aliased in the returned pressure field and must remain
                         alive as long as the field. The position vectors of
                         mesh vertices are expressed in the sphere's frame S.
 @param hydroelastic_modulus  Scale extent to pressure.
 @param margin           The magnitude of the margin δ.
 @return                 The pressure field defined on the tetrahedral mesh.
 @pre                    `hydroelastic_modulus` is strictly positive.
                         `mesh_S` represents the sphere and has enough
                         resolution to represent the pressure field.
 @tparam T               The scalar type for representing the mesh
                         vertex positions and the pressure value.

  //     layers, and define linear pressure fields in each offset with
  //     different elastic modulus.
