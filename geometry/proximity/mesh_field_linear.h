/**
 %MeshFieldLinear represents a continuous piecewise-linear scalar field `f`
 defined on a (triangular or tetrahedral) mesh; the field value changes
 linearly within each element E (triangle or tetrahedron), and the gradient
 ∇f is constant within each element. The field is continuous across adjacent
 elements, but its gradient is discontinuous from one element to the other.

 To represent a piecewise linear field f, we store one field value per vertex
 of the mesh. Each element E (triangle or tetrahedron) has (d+1) vertices,
 where d is the dimension of the element. For triangle, d = 2, and for
 tetrahedron, d = 3.

 On each element E, we define a linear function fᵉ:ℝ³→ℝ using the field values
 at vertices of E. The gradient ∇fᵉ:ℝ³→ℝ³ is a constant map, so we write ∇fᵉ
 for the constant gradient vector on E as well. For a point Q in element E, we
 have:

        f(Q) = fᵉ(Q) for Q ∈ E,
       ∇f(Q) = ∇fᵉ for Q ∈ E.

 Notice that the domain of fᵉ is the entire space of ℝ³, while the domain of f
 is the underlying space of the mesh.

 The following sections are details for interested readers.

 <h3> Barycentric coordinate </h3>

 For a linear triangle or tetrahedron element E in 3-D, we use barycentric
 coordinate:

       (b₀, b₁, b₂)     for triangle,
       (b₀, b₁, b₂, b₃) for tetrahedron,
       ∑bᵢ = 1, bᵢ ≥ 0,

 to identify a point Q that lies in the simplicial element E. The coefficient
 bᵢ is the weight of vertex Vᵉᵢ of the element E, where the index i is a local
 index within the element E, not the global index of the entire mesh. In other
 words, vertex Vᵉᵢ is the iᵗʰ vertex of E, not the iᵗʰ vertex among all vertices
 in the mesh. The point Q in E can be expressed as:

       Q = ∑bᵉᵢ(Q)Vᵉᵢ,

 where we indicate the barycentric coordinate of a point Q on an element E as
 bᵉᵢ(Q).

 <h3> Field value from barycentric coordinates </h3>

 At a point Q in element E, the piecewise linear field f has value:

       f(Q) = fᵉ(Q) = ∑bᵉᵢ(Q)Fᵉᵢ

 where Fᵉᵢ is the field value at the iᵗʰ vertex of element E.

 <h3> Frame dependency </h3>

 A %MeshFieldLinear is a frame-dependent quantity. Instances of a field should
 be named, as with any other frame-dependent quantity, with a trailing _F
 indicating the field's frame F. The field's frame is implicitly defined to be
 the same as the mesh's frame on which the field is instantiated. The field's
 frame affects two APIs:

   - The gradients reported by EvaluateGradient() are expressed in the field's
     frame.
   - The cartesian point passed to EvaluateCartesian() must be measured and
     expressed in the field's frame.

 The field (along with its corresponding mesh) can be transformed into a new
 frame by invoking the TransformVertices() method on the mesh and Transform()
 on the field, passing the same math::RigidTransform to both.

 <h3> Gradient </h3>

 Consider each bᵉᵢ:ℝ³→ℝ as a linear function, its gradient ∇bᵉᵢ:ℝ³→ℝ³ is a
 constant map, and we write ∇bᵉᵢ for the constant gradient vector. The
 gradient of the piecewise linear field f at a point Q in an element E is:

       ∇f(Q) = ∇fᵉ = ∑Fᵉᵢ∇bᵉᵢ.

 <h3> Field value from Cartesian coordinates </h3>

 At a point Q in element E, the piecewise linear field f has value:

       f(Q) = ∇fᵉ⋅Q + fᵉ(0,0,0).

 Notice that (0,0,0) may or may not lie in element E.

  /** Constructs a MeshFieldLinear.
   @param values  The field value at each vertex of the mesh.
   @param mesh    The mesh M to which this field refers.
   @param calculate_gradient Calculate gradient field when true, default is
                  true. Calculating gradient allows EvaluateCartesian() to
                  evaluate the field directly instead of converting
                  Cartesian coordinates to barycentric coordinates first.
                  If calculate_gradient is false, EvaluateCartesian() will be
                  slower. On the other hand, calculating gradient requires
                  certain quality from mesh elements. If the mesh quality is
                  very poor, calculating gradient may throw.

   You can use the parameter `calculate_gradient` to trade time and space
   of this constructor for speed of EvaluateCartesian().
   For `calculate_gradient` = true (by default), this constructor will take
   longer time to compute and will store one field-gradient vector for each
   element in the mesh, but the interpolation by EvaluateCartesian() will be
   faster because we will use a dot product with the Cartesian coordinates
   directly, instead of solving a linear system to convert Cartesian
   coordinates to barycentric coordinates first. For `calculate_gradient` =
   false, this constructor will be faster and use less memory, but
   EvaluateCartesian() will be slower.

   When `calculate_gradient` = true, EvaluateGradient() on a mesh element
   will be available. Otherwise, EvaluateGradient() will `throw`.

   The following features are independent of the choice of `calculate_gradient`.

   - Evaluating the field at a vertex.
   - Evaluating the field at a user-given barycentric coordinate.

   @note When `calculate_gradient` = true, a poor quality element can cause
   `throw` due to numerical errors in calculating field gradients. A poor
   quality element is defined as having an extremely large aspect ratio
   R=E/h, where E is the longest edge length and h is the shortest height.
   A height of a triangular element is the distance between a vertex and its
   opposite edge. A height of a tetrahedral element is the distance between a
   vertex and its opposite triangular face. For example, an extremely skinny
   triangle has poor quality, and a tetrahedron with four vertices almost
   co-planar also has poor quality. The exact threshold of the acceptable aspect
   ratio depends on many factors including the underlying scalar type and the
   exact shape and size of the element; however, a rough conservative
   estimation is 1e12.

   @pre   The `mesh` is non-null, and the number of entries in `values` is the
          same as the number of vertices of the mesh.
