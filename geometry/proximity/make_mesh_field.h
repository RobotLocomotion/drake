/* Creates a pressure field on a tetrahedral volume mesh of a (possibly
 non-convex) shape. This function complements MakeConvexPressureField().

 Given the distance field ϕ(x) (defined positive inside the object), we define
 the extent function as in the Elastic Foundation Model, i.e. e(x) =
 (-ϕ(x)-δ)/(H-δ), where the elastic foundation depth H is defined as the maximum
 distance ϕ(x) over the volume of the mesh (actually the maximum ϕ(xᵢ) over all
 mesh vertices xᵢ). δ is the margin. The pressure field is then defined as p(x)
 = E⋅e(x). Therefore the zero pressure level set is located at a distance δ from
 the surface, and the maximum pressure is p = E.

 @param[in] mesh_M   A pointer to a tetrahedral mesh.
                     It is aliased in the returned pressure field and must
                     remain alive as long as the field.
 @param[in] hydroelastic_modulus   Scale penetration extent to pressure.
                     Its unit is Pascals. See [Elandt2019].
 @param[in] margin   Margin δ.
 @return             The pressure field defined on the tetrahedral mesh.

 @pre                `hydroelastic_modulus` is strictly positive.
                     `mesh_M` is non-null.
 @pre               H > δ.

 @throw  std::exception if the mesh has no interior vertices.

 @tparam T          The scalar type for representing the mesh vertex
                    positions and the pressure value. It must be double
                    or AutoDiffXd.

  [Elandt2019]    R. Elandt, E. Drumwright, M. Sherman, and A. Ruina. A
                  pressure field model for fast, robust approximation of net
                  contact force and moment between nominally rigid objects.
                  IROS 2019: 8238-8245.
