 deformation of a mesh -- in other words, vertex positions can be changed. The
 topology of the mesh is preserved.

 Deforming a mesh can be a dangerous proposition if that mesh is accessed or
 referenced by some other class (e.g., MeshFieldLinear). Deforming the mesh can
 cause downstream dependencies to become invalid. Meshes should only be deformed
 by those who own all downstream dependencies and update them accordingly. */
