 for a given geometry pair. Filtered pairs do not contribute to the results.

  /* The "filter state" is a 2d table. For N registered geometries, it is
   an NxN table where cell (i, j) reports the filter status of the ith and jth
   geometries (although i and j are actually GeometryIds).

   Because a pair's filter status is symmetric (e.g., (a, b) and (b, a) are
   equivalent), we only encode a triangular portion of the table. We have two
   types that work together to define the table: GeometryMap and FilterState.

   FilterState maps a GeometryId to the filter relationship with all other
   registered geometries with *greater* GeometryId values. That set of
   geometries is contained in a GeometryMap, where each entry on that "row"
   is the key-value pair (other_id, filter_pair_state).

   So, given a FilterState instance (filter_state) and two GeometryIds, a and b,
   we could set the filtered state as (assuming a < b):

      filter_state[a][b] = kFiltered;

   As a concrete example, if we've registered GeometryId values 10, 20, 30, 40,
   the filter state would have keys {10, 20, 30, 40} which each maps to a
   corresponding GeometryMap as illustrated below.
