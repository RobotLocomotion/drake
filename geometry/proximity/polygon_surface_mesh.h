   The vertices are simply a vector of position vectors (interpreted as being
   measured and expressed in the mesh's frame M).

   The polygon data is more complex. Syntactically, it is a sequence of integers
   which _encodes_ P polygons. Each polygon can have an arbitrary number of
   vertices. The encoding of the P polygons is as follows:

       |c₁|v₁₀|v₁₁|...|cᵢ|cᵢ₀|cᵢ₁|...|cₚ|cₚ₀|cₚ₁|...|

   Each polygon is defined in sequence. The definition consists of an integer
   indicating the *number* of vertices in that polygon (c₁, cᵢ, and cₘ in the
   illustration above). The next cᵢ integers in the sequence are zero-based
   indices into the vector of vertex positions (indicating which vertices the
   polygon spans). The vertex indices are sorted such that the plane normal
   found by applying the right-handed rule is used as the face normal.

   This implies the following:
     Polygon one:
       Located at index i₁ = 0 in `face_data`.
       c₁ = face_data[i₁] is the number of vertices in polygon one.
     Polygon two:
       Located at index i₂ = i₁ + c₁ + 1 in `face_data`.
       c₂ = face_data[i₂] is the number of vertices in polygon zero.
     Polygon j:
       Located at index iⱼ = iⱼ₋₁ + cⱼ₋₁ + 1
       cⱼ = face_data[iⱼ]

   The polygons must all be planar and convex.

   @param face_data  The sequence of counts and indices which encode the faces
                     of the mesh (see above).
   @param vertices   The vertex positions, measured and expressed in this
                     mesh's frame.
   @pre The indices in `face_data` all refer to valid indices into `vertices`.

   @note If `face_data` includes a zero-area polygon, that polygon will have
         a non-NaN centroid chosen arbitrarily. For hydroelastics, this is
         acceptable because its zero area will neutralize its contribution to
         computation of contact wrench. If all polygons have zero area, the
         mesh's centroid will be chosen arbitrarily as well.
