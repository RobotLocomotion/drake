/* Generates a tetrahedral volume mesh of a given box by medial axis (MA)
 subdivision. The box is subdivided into blocks using its MA, and then the
 blocks are subdivided into tetrahedra. Using this mesh with MeshFieldLinear,
 we can represent the distance-to-boundary function φ of the box accurately and
 economically. The same thing is true for a hydroelastic pressure field that
 is a constant scaling of φ.

 The box's MA is the set of all points having more than one closest point on
 the box's boundary. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis for more
 about the medial axis.)

 The following picture schematically shows the analogy of MA in two dimensions.
 MA of the rectangle (drawn with "--", "|", and "+") consists of the (open)
 line segments (drawn with arrows) from each of the rectangle's vertices to a
 medial vertex (drawn with "o") and the (closed) line segment (drawn with "==")
 connecting the two medial vertices.

  In 2D, a rectangle's MA has 2 vertices.   In 2D, a square's MA has 1 vertex.

 In three dimensions, a box B's MA has one, two, or four vertices Mᵢ at
 the points having four or more closest points on the box's boundary.
 The MA comprises (L for set of lines, P for set of polygons):

 L1. the eight (open) line segments from B's vertex to MA's vertex,
 L2. zero, one, or four line segments (aligned to B's frame) connecting MA's
     vertices Mᵢ and Mⱼ together,
 P3. the twelve polygons that are isosceles trapezoids or isosceles triangles
     (Each polygon is bounded by an edge VᵢVⱼ of the box B, two lines VᵢMₖ and
     VⱼMₗ in L1, and, for trapezoids, the line MₖMₗ in L2, i.e., Mₖ ≠ Mₗ),
 P4. possibly one rectangle or square of four MA's vertices bounded by the
     four lines in L2 (The rectangle degenerates to one MA's vertex for a
     cube and the line in L2 for a long box with two small square faces).

 The following examples describe MAs of boxes with various shapes.

 Example 1. MA of a box with three distinct dimensions bz < bx < by comprises
   four isosceles triangles (not shown), eight isosceles trapezoids (not shown),
   and one rectangle M₀M₁M₂M₃, as shown in this picture:

          V₇----------------------------------------------V₆
         /|                                              /|
        / |                                             / |
       /  |                                            /  |      z
      /   |    M₃---------------------------------M₂  /   |      |
     /    V₃--/----------------------------------/---/----V₂     |

   |/                                              |/
   V₀----------------------------------------------V₁

   In this example, the MA's faces are:
     - the triangular faces (Vᵢ, Mⱼ, Vₖ):
       (V₀, M₀, V₄), (V₁, M₁, V₅), (V₂, M₂, V₆), (V₃, M₃, V₇),
     - the trapezoidal faces (Vᵢ, Mⱼ, Mₖ, Vₗ):
       (V₀, M₀, M₃, V₃), (V₄, M₀, M₃, V₇), (V₁, M₁, M₀, V₀), (V₅, M₁, M₀, V₄),
       (V₂, M₂, M₁, V₁), (V₆, M₂, M₁, V₅), (V₃, M₃, M₂, V₂), (V₇, M₃, M₂, V₆),
     - and the rectangular face: (M₀, M₁, M₂, M₃).

 Example 2. MA of a long box with two small square faces (the box dimensions
   are bz = bx < by) comprises eight isosceles triangles (not shown) and four
   isosceles trapezoids (not shown) that share the medial edge M₀M₁, as shown
   in this picture:

        V₇----------------------------------------V₆
       / |                                       / |
      /  |                                      /  |      z
     /   |                                     /   |      |
   V₄----------------------------------------V₅    |      |
   |     |   M₀------------------------M₁    |     |      o-------y
   |    V₃-----------------------------------|----V₂     /
   |   /                                     |   /      /
   |  /                                      |  /      x
   | /                                       | /
   V₀----------------------------------------V₁

   In this example, the MA's faces are:
     - the triangular faces (Vᵢ, Mⱼ, Vₖ):
       (V₀, M₀, V₄), (V₁, M₁, V₅), (V₂, M₁, V₆), (V₃, M₀, V₇),
       (V₀, M₀, V₃), (V₄, M₀, V₇), (V₂, M₁, V₁), (V₆, M₁, V₅),
     - and the trapezoidal faces (Vᵢ, Mⱼ, Mₖ, Vₗ):
       (V₁, M₁, M₀, V₀), (V₅, M₁, M₀, V₄), (V₃, M₀, M₁, V₂), (V₇, M₀, M₁, V₆).

 Example 3. MA of a cube comprises twelve isosceles triangles (not shown)
   sharing the medial vertex M₀, as shown in this picture:

        V₇--------------V₆
       / |             / |
      /  |            /  |      z
     /   |           /   |      |
   V₄--------------V₅    |      |
   |     |   M₀    |     |      o-------y
   |    V₃---------|----V₂     /
   |   /           |   /      /
   |  /            |  /      x
   | /             | /
   V₀--------------V₁

  In this example, the MA's faces are the triangular faces (Vᵢ, M₀, Vₖ):
       (V₀, M₀, V₄), (V₁, M₀, V₅), (V₂, M₀, V₆), (V₃, M₀, V₇),
       (V₀, M₀, V₃), (V₄, M₀, V₇), (V₂, M₀, V₁), (V₆, M₀, V₅),
       (V₁, M₀, V₀), (V₅, M₀, V₄), (V₃, M₀, V₂), (V₇, M₀, V₆).

 The output mesh will have these properties:

   1. The generated vertices are unique. There are no repeating vertices in
      the list of vertex coordinates.
   2. The generated tetrahedra are _conforming_. Two tetrahedra intersect in
      their shared face, or shared edge, or shared vertex, or not at all.
      There is no partial overlapping of two tetrahedra.
   3. Depending on the shape of the box, the mesh has 12, 16, or 24
      tetrahedra and 9, 10, or 12 vertices, respectively.
      3.1 The mesh of a cube has 12 tetrahedra. (MA has only one vertex
          in the cube's interior.)
      3.2 The mesh of a long box with two small square faces has 16
          tetrahedra. (MA has only two vertices in the box's interior
          forming a line segment.)
      3.3 The mesh of a shallow box with two big square faces has 24
          tetrahedra. (MA has four vertices in the box's interior forming a
          square.)
      3.4 The mesh of a box with three distinct dimensions also has 24
          tetrahedra. (MA has four vertices in the box's interior forming a
          rectangle.)
