/* @group Frames, Geometries, and Instances

 There are a number of frames relating to how geometries are handled in
 RenderEngineGl. What they are and how they relate can be confusing. This
 discussion defines the frames, their relationships, and looks at the provenance
 of the values in those relationships (with particular focus on what values are
 stored in Drake entities and how they are used).

   W: Drake's world frame.
   G: Drake's geometry frame (this is what gets posed by SceneGraph). In this
      file it is the instance's frame.
   M: An OpenGl "model" frame. This is a conceptual frame relating the parts of
      a prop. It is neither the instance frame nor the frame that OpenGlGeometry
      vertex positions or normals are measured and expressed in. For example,
      the underlying model data can be scaled (as with Mesh or Convex shapes) to
      create the effective geometry instance. Also, the instance can be built of
      multiple parts (the constituent pieces of a "prop") and those parts can
      themselves be transformed relative to each other to build the model.
   N: The frame in which the vertex positions and normals of an OpenGlGeometry
      are measured and expressed.

 Relationships between these frames:

   While Drake mostly focuses on rigid transforms between frames (X_AB) and
   relative orientations (R_AB), rendering needs to describe additional
   relationships. So, in addition to the X_ and R_ prefixes, we also use the
   P_, S_, T_, and N_ prefixes. All transforms noted here concatenate as 4x4
   homogeneous matrices. In implementation, they may be replaced with an
   alternative, functionally equivalent representation.

     P_: A homogenous matrix representing translation. The same as a
         RigidTransform consisting of only a translation.
     S_: A *scale* matrix. A diagonal matrix with Sx, Sy, and Sz on the
         diagonal.
     T_: An affine transform which can include translation, rotation, and
         anisotropic scale. T_AB = P_AB * R_AB * S_AB.
     N_: The transform to apply to a mesh's normals to re-express them in
         another frame. Given T_AB = P_AB * R_AB * S_AB, we can derive the
         corresponding normal transform: N_AB = R_AB * S⁻¹_AB.

   Immutable relationships defined when a Shape is registered with the engine:

      S_GM: The scaling applied to the underlying "model" data to create the
            requested Drake-specified geometry. This can be the explicitly
            declared scale factor associated with a Mesh or Convex. It can also
            be scale factors applied by Drake to map a canonical shape to a
            particular size. For example, we store the mesh of a unit sphere,
            but apply an arbitrary scale to model an ellipsoid; this scale
            matrix contains that transformation.
      S_MN: For some sources (e.g., glTF files), an OpenGlGeometry will have its
            vertex data expressed in a different frame from that of the file (or
            model). This is the scale between those two frames.
      T_MN: The pose (not necessarily RigidTransform) of the vertex position
            data associated with a single OpenGlGeometry instance (sometimes
            referred to as a "part" or "node") in the conceptual frame of the
            model.
      T_GN: The transform for measuring and expressing the vertex position data
            associated with an OpenGlGeometry in the instance's frame. Defined
            as T_GN = S_GM * T_MN
      N_GN: The transform for expressing the vertex normal data associated with
            an OpenGlGeometry in the instance's frame.

   Relationships that depend on the pose of the instance (as defined by
   SceneGraph):

      X_WG: The pose (RigidTransform) of the Drake geometry frame in Drake's
            world frame. This is provided by SceneGraph and provided to
            RenderEngineGl via UpdateVisualPose() and updates frequently.
      T_WN: T_WG = X_WG * S_GN.
      N_WN: N_WN = R_WG * N_GN.

 geometry is defined by the handles to various objects in the OpenGL context.

 The code that constructs instances is completely responsible for guaranteeing
 that the array and buffer values are valid in the OpenGl context and that the
 index buffer size is likewise sized correctly.
