/** The %SceneGraphInspector serves as a mechanism to query the topological
 structure of a SceneGraph instance. The topological structure consists of all
 of the SceneGraph data that does _not_ depend on input pose data. Including,
 but not limited to:

 - names of frames and geometries
 - hierarchies (parents of geometries, parents of frames, etc.)
 - geometry parameters (e.g., contact, rendering, visualization)
 - fixed poses of geometries relative to frames

 In contrast, the following pieces of data *do* depend on input pose data and
 _cannot_ be performed with the %SceneGraphInspector (see the QueryObject
 instead):

 - world pose of frames or geometry
 - collision queries
 - proximity queries

 A %SceneGraphInspector cannot be instantiated explicitly. Nor can it be copied
 or moved. A _reference_ to a %SceneGraphInspector instance can be acquired from

 - a SceneGraph instance (to inspect the state of the system's _model_), or
 - a QueryObject instance (to inspect the state of the scene graph data stored
   in the context).

 The reference should not be persisted (and, as previously indicated, cannot
 be copied). %SceneGraphInspector instances are cheap; they can be created,
 queried, and thrown out. If there is any doubt about the valid lifespan of
 a %SceneGraphInspector, throw out the old instance and request a new instance.

 @tparam T The scalar of the associated SceneGraph instance. The template
 parameter is provided for the sake of compatibility, although no queries (or
 their results) depend on the scalar.  */
