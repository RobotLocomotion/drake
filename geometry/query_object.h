/** The %QueryObject serves as a mechanism to perform geometry queries on the
 world's geometry. The SceneGraph has an abstract-valued port that contains
 a  %QueryObject (i.e., a %QueryObject-valued output port).

 To perform geometry queries on SceneGraph:
   - a LeafSystem must have a %QueryObject-valued input port and connect it to
     the corresponding query output port on SceneGraph,
   - the querying LeafSystem can evaluate the input port, retrieving a `const
     QueryObject&` in return, and, finally,
   - invoke the appropriate method on the %QueryObject.

 The const reference returned by the input port is considered "live" - it is
 linked to the context, system, and cache (making full use of all of those
 mechanisms). This const reference should _never_ be persisted; doing so can
 lead to erroneous query results. It is simpler and more advisable to acquire it
 for evaluation in a limited scope (e.g., CalcTimeDerivatives()) and then
 discard it. If a %QueryObject is needed for many separate functions in a
 LeafSystem, each should re-evaluate the input port. The underlying caching
 mechanism should make the cost of this negligible.

 The %QueryObject _can_ be copied. The copied instance is no longer "live"; it
 is now "baked". Essentially, it freezes the state of the live scene graph in
 its current configuration and disconnects it from the system and context. This
 means, even if the original context changes values, the copied/baked instance
 will always reproduce the same query results. This baking process is not cheap
 and should not be done without consideration.

 <h2>Queries and scalar type</h2>

 A %QueryObject _cannot_ be converted to a different scalar type. A %QueryObject
 of scalar type T can only be acquired from the output port of a SceneGraph
 of type T evaluated on a corresponding Context, also of type T.

 %QueryObject's support for arbitrary scalar type is incomplete. Not all queries
 support all scalar types to the same degree. In some cases the level of support
 is obvious (such as when the query is declared *explicitly* in terms of a
 double-valued scalar -- see ComputePointPairPenetration()). In other cases,
 where the query is expressed in terms of scalar `T`, the query may have
 restrictions. If a query has restricted scalar support, it is included in
 the query's documentation.

  /**
   Computes the signed distance together with the nearest points across all
   pairs of geometries in the world. Reports both the separating geometries
   and penetrating geometries.

   This query provides φ(A, B), the signed distance between two objects A and B.

   If the objects do not overlap (i.e., A ⋂ B = ∅), φ > 0 and represents the
   minimal distance between the two objects. More formally:
   φ = min(|Aₚ - Bₚ|)
   ∀ Aₚ ∈ A and Bₚ ∈ B.
   @note The pair (Aₚ, Bₚ) is a "witness" of the distance.
   The pair need not be unique (think of two parallel planes).

   If the objects touch or overlap (i.e., A ⋂ B ≠ ∅), φ ≤ 0 and can be
   interpreted as the negative penetration depth. It is the smallest length of
   the vector v, such that by shifting one object along that vector relative to
   the other, the two objects will no longer be overlapping. More formally,
   φ(A, B) = -min |v|.
   s.t (Tᵥ · A) ⋂ B = ∅
   where Tᵥ is a rigid transformation that displaces A by the vector v, namely
   Tᵥ · A = {u + v | ∀ u ∈ A}.
   By implication, there exist points Aₚ and Bₚ on the surfaces of objects A and
   B, respectively, such that Aₚ + v = Bₚ, Aₚ ∈ A ∩ B, Bₚ ∈ A ∩ B. These points
   are the witnesses to the penetration.

   This method is affected by collision filtering; geometry pairs that
   have been filtered will not produce signed distance query results.

   For a geometry pair (A, B), the returned results will always be reported in
   a fixed order (e.g., always (A, B) and never (B, A)). The _basis_ for the
   ordering is arbitrary (and therefore undocumented), but guaranteed to be
   fixed and repeatable.

   Notice that this is an O(N²) operation, where N
   is the number of geometries remaining in the world after applying collision
   filter. We report the distance between dynamic objects, and between dynamic
   and anchored objects. We DO NOT report the distance between two anchored
   objects.

   <h3>Scalar support</h3>
   This function does not support halfspaces. If an unfiltered pair contains
   a halfspace, an exception will be thrown for all scalar types. Otherwise,
   this query supports all other pairs of Drake geometry types for `double`.
   For `AutoDiffXd`, it only supports distance between sphere-box and
   sphere-sphere. If there are any unfiltered geometry pairs that include other
   geometries, the AutoDiff throws an exception.

   Computes the signed distances and gradients to a query point from each
   geometry in the scene.

   @warning Currently supports spheres, boxes, and cylinders only. Silently
   ignores other kinds of geometries, which will be added later.

   This query provides φᵢ(p), φᵢ:ℝ³→ℝ, the signed distance to the position
   p of a query point from geometry Gᵢ in the scene.  It returns an array of
   the signed distances from all geometries.

   Optionally you can specify a threshold distance that will filter out any
   object beyond the threshold. By default, we report distances from the query
   point to every object.

   This query also provides the gradient vector ∇φᵢ(p) of the signed distance
   function from geometry Gᵢ. Note that, in general, if p is outside Gᵢ, then
   ∇φᵢ(p) equals the unit vector in the direction from the nearest point Nᵢ on
   Gᵢ's surface to p. If p is inside Gᵢ, then ∇φᵢ(p) is in the direction from
   p to Nᵢ. This observation is written formally as:

   ∇φᵢ(p) = (p - Nᵢ)/|p - Nᵢ| if p is outside Gᵢ

   ∇φᵢ(p) = -(p - Nᵢ)/|p - Nᵢ| if p is inside Gᵢ

   Note that ∇φᵢ(p) is also defined on Gᵢ's surface, but we cannot use the
   above formula.

   <h3>Scalar support</h3>
   This query only supports computing distances from the point to spheres,
   boxes, and cylinders for both `double` and `AutoDiffXd` scalar types. If
   the SceneGraph contains any other geometry shapes, they will be silently
   ignored.

   @note For a sphere G, the signed distance function φᵢ(p) has an undefined
   gradient vector at the center of the sphere--every point on the sphere's
   surface has the same distance to the center.  In this case, we will assign
   ∇φᵢ(p) the unit vector Gx (x-directional vector of G's frame) expressed
   in World frame.

   @note For a box, at a point p on an edge or a corner of the box, the signed
   distance function φᵢ(p) has an undefined gradient vector.  In this case, we
   will assign a unit vector in the direction of the average of the outward
   face unit normals of the incident faces of the edge or the corner.
   A point p is considered being on a face, or an edge, or a corner of the
   box if it lies within a certain tolerance from them.

   @note For a box B, if a point p is inside the box, and it is equidistant to
   to multiple nearest faces, the signed distance function φᵢ(p) at p will have
   an undefined gradient vector. There is a nearest point candidate associated
   with each nearest face. In this case, we arbitrarily pick the point Nᵢ
   associated with one of the nearest faces.  Please note that, due to the
   possible round off error arising from applying a pose X_WG to B, there is no
   guarantee which of the nearest faces will be used.

   @note The signed distance function is a continuous function with respect to
   the position of the query point, but its gradient vector field may
   not be continuous. Specifically at a position equidistant to multiple
   nearest points, its gradient vector field is not continuous.

   @note For a convex object, outside the object at positive distance from
   the boundary, the signed distance function is smooth (having continuous
   first-order partial derivatives).

   @param[in] p_WQ            Position of a query point Q in world frame W.
   @param[in] threshold       We ignore any object beyond this distance.
                              By default, it is infinity, so we report
