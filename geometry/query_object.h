class SceneGraph;

/** The %QueryObject serves as a mechanism to perform geometry queries on the
 world's geometry. The SceneGraph has an abstract-valued port that contains
 a  %QueryObject (i.e., a %QueryObject-valued output port).

 To perform geometry queries on SceneGraph:
   - a LeafSystem must have a %QueryObject-valued input port and connect it to
     the corresponding query output port on SceneGraph,
   - the querying LeafSystem can evaluate the input port, retrieving a `const
     QueryObject&` in return, and, finally,
   - invoke the appropriate method on the %QueryObject.

 The const reference returned by the input port is considered "live" - it is
 linked to the context, system, and cache (making full use of all of those
 mechanisms). This const reference should _never_ be persisted; doing so can
 lead to erroneous query results. It is simpler and more advisable to acquire it
 for evaluation in a limited scope (e.g., CalcTimeDerivatives()) and then
 discard it. If a %QueryObject is needed for many separate functions in a
 LeafSystem, each should re-evaluate the input port. The underlying caching
 mechanism should make the cost of this negligible.

 The %QueryObject _can_ be copied. The copied instance is no longer "live"; it
 is now "baked". Essentially, it freezes the state of the live scene graph in
 its current configuration and disconnects it from the system and context. This
 means, even if the original context changes values, the copied/baked instance
 will always reproduce the same query results. This baking process is not cheap
 and should not be done without consideration.

 @anchor query_object_precision_methodology
 <h2>Queries and scalar type</h2>

 A %QueryObject _cannot_ be converted to a different scalar type. A %QueryObject
 of scalar type T can only be acquired from the output port of a SceneGraph
 of type T evaluated on a corresponding Context, also of type T.

 %QueryObject's support for arbitrary scalar type is incomplete. Not all queries
 support all scalar types to the same degree. Furthermore, the queries are
 typically served by *families* of algorithms. The evaluation of a query between
 a particular pair of geometries will depend on the query, the pair of geometry
 types involved, and the scalar type. From query to query, the treatment of
 a geometry (or geometry pair) for a given scalar type can vary in many ways,
 including but not limited to: ignoring the geometry, throwing an exception,
 results with limited precision, or full, accurate support. The queries below
 provide tables to help inform your expectations when evaluating queries. The
 tables all use a common methodology and admit a common interpretation.

 For each (query, geometry-pair, scalar) combination, we create a set of
 geometric configurations with known answers. We evaluate the precision of the
 query result (if supported at all) over the entire set and report the *worst*
 observed error. This is a purely empirical approach and doesn't fully
 characterize the families of underlying algorithms, and the reported error
 may be misleading in that we've missed far worse latent error or that the
 error reported doesn't well represent the average case.

 The families of algorithms also differ in how their inherent errors scale with
 the scale of the problem (e.g., size of geometries, magnitude of
 distance/depth, etc.) Attempting to fully characterize that aspect is both
 arduous and problematic, so, we've chosen a more *representative* approach.

 Because Drake is primarily intended for robot simulation, we've created
 geometric configurations on the scale of common robot manipulators (on the
 order of 20cm). We position them with a known penetration depth (or separating
 distance) of 2 mm. The error reported is the deviation from that expected
 result.

 When interpreting the tables, keep the following in mind:
   - The table illustrates trends in *broad* strokes, only. It does not
     represent an exhaustive analysis.
   - If your problem involves larger geometries, greater penetration depths, or
     larger separating distances, the error will vary. Do not assume that
     observed error in this context is necessarily relative -- there truly is
     that much variability in the families of algorithms.
   - These values are an attempt to capture the *worst* case outcome. The
     error shown is a single-significant-digit approximation of that observed
     error.
   - These values may not actually represent the true worst case; discovering
     the true worst case is generally challenging. These represent our best
     effort to date. If you find outcomes that are worse those reported here,
     please <a href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/new">
     submit a bug</a>.
   - These tables represent Drake's transient state. The eventual goal is to
     report no more than 1e-14 error across all supportable geometry pairs
     and scalars. At that point, the table will simply disappear.

   has a specific definition of the signed distance being positive, negative,
   or zero associated with some notions of being outside, inside, or on
   the boundary.

   These queries provide bookkeeping data like geometry id(s) of the geometries
   involved and the important locations on the boundaries of these geometries.

   The signed distance function is a continuous function. Its partial
   derivatives are continuous almost everywhere.

  /**
   Computes the signed distance together with the nearest points across all
   pairs of geometries in the world. Reports both the separating geometries
   and penetrating geometries.

   This query provides φ(A, B), the signed distance between two objects A and B.

   If the objects do not overlap (i.e., A ⋂ B = ∅), φ > 0 and represents the
   minimal distance between the two objects. More formally:
   φ = min(|Aₚ - Bₚ|)
   ∀ Aₚ ∈ A and Bₚ ∈ B.
   @note The pair (Aₚ, Bₚ) is a "witness" of the distance.
   The pair need not be unique (think of two parallel planes).

   If the objects touch or overlap (i.e., A ⋂ B ≠ ∅), φ ≤ 0 and can be
   interpreted as the negative penetration depth. It is the smallest length of
   the vector v, such that by shifting one object along that vector relative to
   the other, the two objects will no longer be overlapping. More formally,
   φ(A, B) = -min |v|.
   s.t (Tᵥ · A) ⋂ B = ∅
   where Tᵥ is a rigid transformation that displaces A by the vector v, namely
   Tᵥ · A = {u + v | ∀ u ∈ A}.
   By implication, there exist points Aₚ and Bₚ on the surfaces of objects A and
   B, respectively, such that Aₚ + v = Bₚ, Aₚ ∈ A ∩ B, Bₚ ∈ A ∩ B. These points
   are the witnesses to the penetration.

   This method is affected by collision filtering; geometry pairs that
   have been filtered will not produce signed distance query results.

   For a geometry pair (A, B), the returned results will always be reported in
   a fixed order (e.g., always (A, B) and never (B, A)). The _basis_ for the
   ordering is arbitrary (and therefore undocumented), but guaranteed to be
   fixed and repeatable.

   Notice that this is an O(N²) operation, where N
   is the number of geometries remaining in the world after applying collision
   filter. We report the distance between dynamic objects, and between dynamic
   and anchored objects. We DO NOT report the distance between two anchored
   objects.

   <h3>Using maximum distance</h3>

   While the algorithm generally has O(N²) complexity in time and space, that
   can be reduced by the judicious use of the `max_distance` parameter. If
   `φ(A, B) > max_distance`, the pair (A, B) will not be included in the
   results (making it O(M²) in space where M < N). Furthermore, the broadphase
   culling algorithm can exploit `max_distance` to *cheaply* eliminate pairs of
   geometry that are "obviously" too far (likewise reducing the time
   complexity).

   Passing `max_distance = 0` is conceptually related to calling
   HasCollisions(). If contact is sparse (very few actually contacting geometry
   pairs), the two invocations will be quite similar in cost. However, the
   distinction between the two is that *this* method would have to include *all*
   pairs that satisfy `φ(A, B) <= 0`, whereas HasCollisions() stops at the
   first. So, the more actually colliding geometry pairs there are, the bigger
   the difference in cost between the two approaches.

   <h3>Characterizing the returned values</h3>

   As discussed in the
   @ref query_object_precision_methodology "class's documentation", this table
   documents the support given by this query for pairs of geometry types and
   scalar. See the description in the link for details on how to interpret the
   table results. The query is symmetric with respect to shape *ordering*, the
   pair (ShapeA, ShapeB) will be the same as (ShapeB, ShapeA), so we only fill
   in half the table.

   Computes the signed distances and gradients to a query point from each
   geometry in the scene.

   This query provides φᵢ(p), φᵢ:ℝ³→ℝ, the signed distance to the position
   p of a query point from geometry Gᵢ in the scene.  It returns an array of
   the signed distances from all geometries.

   Optionally you can specify a threshold distance that will filter out any
   object beyond the threshold. By default, we report distances from the query
   point to every object.

   This query also provides the gradient vector ∇φᵢ(p) of the signed distance
   function from geometry Gᵢ. Note that, in general, if p is outside Gᵢ, then
   ∇φᵢ(p) equals the unit vector in the direction from the nearest point Nᵢ on
   Gᵢ's surface to p. If p is inside Gᵢ, then ∇φᵢ(p) is in the direction from
   p to Nᵢ. This observation is written formally as:

   ∇φᵢ(p) = (p - Nᵢ)/|p - Nᵢ| if p is outside Gᵢ

   ∇φᵢ(p) = -(p - Nᵢ)/|p - Nᵢ| if p is inside Gᵢ

   Note that ∇φᵢ(p) is also defined on Gᵢ's surface, but we cannot use the
   above formula.

   <h3>Characterizing the returned values</h3>

   This table is a variant of that described in this
   @ref query_object_precision_methodology "class's documentation". The query
   evaluates signed distance between *one* shape and a point (in contrast to
   other queries which involve two shapes). Therefore, we don't need a matrix
   of shape pairs, but a list of shapes. Otherwise, the methodology is the same
   as described, with the point being represented as a zero-radius sphere.

   - ᵃ Unsupported geometry/scalar combinations are simply ignored; no results
       are reported for that geometry.
   - ᵇ This uses an *iterative* algorithm which introduces a relatively large
       and variable error. For example, as the eccentricity of the ellipsoid
       increases, this error may get worse. It also depends on the location of
       the projection of the query point on the ellipsoid; the closer that point
       is to the high curvature area, the bigger the effect. It is not
       immediately clear how much worse the answer will get.

   @note For a sphere G, the signed distance function φᵢ(p) has an undefined
   gradient vector at the center of the sphere--every point on the sphere's
   surface has the same distance to the center.  In this case, we will assign
   ∇φᵢ(p) the unit vector Gx (x-directional vector of G's frame) expressed
   in World frame.

   @note For a box, at a point p on an edge or a corner of the box, the signed
   distance function φᵢ(p) has an undefined gradient vector.  In this case, we
   will assign a unit vector in the direction of the average of the outward
   face unit normals of the incident faces of the edge or the corner.
   A point p is considered being on a face, or an edge, or a corner of the
   box if it lies within a certain tolerance from them.

   @note For a box B, if a point p is inside the box, and it is equidistant to
   multiple nearest faces, the signed distance function φᵢ(p) at p will have
   an undefined gradient vector. There is a nearest point candidate associated
   with each nearest face. In this case, we arbitrarily pick the point Nᵢ
   associated with one of the nearest faces.  Please note that, due to the
   possible round off error arising from applying a pose X_WG to B, there is no
   guarantee which of the nearest faces will be used.

   @note The signed distance function is a continuous function with respect to
   the position of the query point, but its gradient vector field may
   not be continuous. Specifically at a position equidistant to multiple
   nearest points, its gradient vector field is not continuous.

   @note For a convex object, outside the object at positive distance from
   the boundary, the signed distance function is smooth (having continuous
   first-order partial derivatives).

   @param[in] p_WQ            Position of a query point Q in world frame W.
   @param[in] threshold       We ignore any object beyond this distance.
                              By default, it is infinity, so we report
                              distances from the query point to every object.

  // This is documented for future consideration, and should not necessarily be
  // interpreted as a guaranteed task.
