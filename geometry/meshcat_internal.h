/* Rewrites a glTF file in memory so that all of its URIs refer to assets in
FileStorage, instead of their original location.

When a glTF file has bundled assets (i.e., data URIs) this decodes and unbundles
them. Meshcat is MUCH slower at loading bundled assets compared to unbundled.

When a glTF file has relative path URIs (i.e., unbundled files on disk), this
loads the files into FileStorage so that we can serve them later, even if the
original file has disappeared in the meantime.

@param[in] mesh_source The MeshSource for the given glTF, used to resolve file
  URIs used in the `gltf_contents`. The actual contents of
  `source.in_memory().mesh_file` will _not_ be used; `gltf_contents` takes
  precedence, but is expected to be a copy of the source's glTF file contents.

@param[in,out] gltf_contents The glTF data named in `mesh_source`. It will be
  edited in place to replace the URIs. (We assume that the caller has created
  this as a unique, editable copy of the glTF data, whether from on-disk or
  in-memory, so here we can just operate on that string as an [in,out]
  parameter.)

@param[in,out] storage The database where assets should be stored.

@returns The handles for all assets cited by `gltf_contents`. */

/* Converts a geometry name into a meshcat path. So, a geometry named
`my_scope::Mesh` becomes my_scope/Mesh.

Note: This replaces all "::" pairs, even if there are multiple instances in
sequence, or it is at the beginning or end of a sequence.

We may produce strings of the form: "a//b", "/a", or "b/". We assume these are
not problematic for the following reasons:

  - "a//b" - meshcat treats multiple '/' in a row as a single '/'.
  - "b/" - meshcat elides trailing '/'.
  - "/a" - although this may *look* like an absolute path, our basic assumption
           is that the transformed geometry name will be concatenated to a
           longer path (so it will never accidentally be used in a way that
           would be interpreted as an absolute path).

(Examples of the slash elision can be seen in meshcat_manual_test.cc -- the
sphere and cylinder shapes.) */
