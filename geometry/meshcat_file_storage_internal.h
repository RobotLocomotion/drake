/* FileStorage maintains an in-memory database with the contents of files, keyed
by their checksum.

For large assets (e.g., images) sometimes we use the msgpack message to transmit
the URL of the asset, instead of the asset as inline data. In that case, we need
to store the asset so that we can serve it over HTTP GET when a browser client
needs it. Our storage must checkpoint the asset in memory -- we can't just keep
around the fs::path and re-read it again later because the file might have
disappeared or changed in the meantime.

This storage is built around shared_ptr and weak_ptr so that users of this class
are responsible for managing the lifetime of the assets. The FileStorage class
only holds weak pointers. The Insert() function returns a shared_ptr to the
caller, who is responsible for keeping that shared_ptr around exactly as long as
the asset should remain in the database. Inserting the same asset again will
bump the use_count (by returning a copy of the same shared_ptr).

Because this class is accessed by both the Meshcat main thread (to insert
assets) and the websocket worker thread (to serve assets), this class is
thread-safe: all functions other than the constructor and destructor take a
mutex lock. */

  The `filename_hint` is purely a debugging aid (e.g., for logging), and is
