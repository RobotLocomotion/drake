/* The underlying engine for performing geometric _proximity_ queries.
 It owns the geometry instances and, once it has been provided with the poses
 of the geometry, it provides geometric queries on that geometry.

 Proximity queries span a range of types, including:

   - penetration
   - distance
   - ray-intersection

 Not all shape queries are fully supported. To add support for a shape:
 1. for fcl versions of the specification, modify CopyShapeOrThrow().
 2. add an instance of the new shape to the CopySemantics test in
    proximity_engine_test.cc.
 3. for penetration, test the new shape in the class BoxPenetrationTest of
    proximity_engine_test.cc and document its configuration.

 <!-- TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI): Fully document the semantics of the proximity
 properties that will affect the proximity engine -- hydroelastic semantics,
 required properties, etc.
