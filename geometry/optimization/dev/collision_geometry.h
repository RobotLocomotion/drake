  /**
   To impose the geometric constraint that this collision geometry is on one
   side of a plane {x|aᵀx+b=0} with a certain margin, we can equivalently write
   this constraint with the following conditions
   1. Some rational functions are always non-negative.
   2. A certain vector has length <= 1.

   For example, if this geometry is a sphere with radius r, and we constrain
   that the sphere is on the positive side of the plane with a margin δ, we can
   impose the following constraint
   aᵀ*p_AS(s) + b ≥ r + δ       (1)
   |a| ≤ 1                      (2)
   where p_AS(s) is the position of the sphere center S expressed in a frame A.
   The left hand side of equation (1) is a rational function of indeterminate
   s. Constraint (2) says the vector a has length <= 1.

   Similarly we can write down the conditions for other geometry types,
   including polytopes and capsules.

   Note that when we don't require a separating margin δ, and the geometry is a
   polytope, then we consider the constraint
   aᵀp_AVᵢ(s) + b ≥ 1 if the polytope is on the positive side of the plane, and
   aᵀp_AVᵢ(s) + b ≤ -1 if the polytope is on the negative side of the plane.
   Note that in this case we don't have the "vector with length <= 1 "
   constraint.

   @param a The normal vector in the separating plane. a is expressed in frame
   A.
   @param b The constant term in the separating plane.
   @param X_AB_multilinear The pose of the collision geometry body (B) in the
   expressed frame A, written as a multilinear polynomial. This quantity is
   generated from
   RationalForwardKinematics::CalcBodyPoseAsMultilinearPolynomial.
   @param rational_forward_kin This object is constructed with the
   MultibodyPlant containing this collision geometry.
   @param separating_margin δ in the documentation above.
   @param plane_side Whether the geometry is on the positive or negative side of
   the plane.
   @param[out] rationals The rationals that should be positive when the geometry
   is on the designated side of the plane.
   @param[out] unit_length_vector The vector that should have length <= 1 when
   the geometry is on the designated side of the plane.
