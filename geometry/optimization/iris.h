/** The IRIS (Iterative Region Inflation by Semidefinite programming) algorithm,
as described in

R. L. H. Deits and R. Tedrake, “Computing large convex regions of obstacle-free
space through semidefinite programming,” Workshop on the Algorithmic
Fundamentals of Robotics, Istanbul, Aug. 2014.
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Deits14.pdf

This algorithm attempts to locally maximize the volume of a convex polytope
representing obstacle-free space given a sample point and list of convex
obstacles. Rather than compute the volume of the polytope directly, the
algorithm maximizes the volume of an inscribed ellipsoid. It alternates between
finding separating hyperplanes between the ellipsoid and the obstacles and then
finding a new maximum-volume inscribed ellipsoid.

@param obstacles is a vector of convex sets representing the occupied space.
@param sample provides a point in the space; the algorithm is initialized using
a tiny sphere around this point. The algorithm is only guaranteed to succeed if
this sample point is collision free (outside of all obstacles), but in practice
the algorithm can often escape bad initialization (assuming the
require_sample_point_is_contained option is false).
@param domain describes the total region of interest; computed IRIS regions will
be inside this domain.  It must be bounded, and is typically a simple bounding
box (e.g. from HPolyhedron::MakeBox).

The @p obstacles, @p sample, and the @p domain must describe elements in the
same ambient dimension (but that dimension can be any positive integer).

QueryObject.

When multiple representations are available for a particular geometry (e.g. a
Box can be represented as either an HPolyhedron or a VPolytope), then this
method will prioritize the representation that we expect is most performant
for the current implementation of the IRIS algorithm.

collisions in configuration space; each potential collision is
probabilistically "certified" by restarting the nonlinear optimization from
random initial seeds inside the candidate IRIS region until it fails to find a
collision in `options.num_collision_infeasible_samples` consecutive attempts.

@param plant describes the kinematics of configuration space.  It must be
connected to a SceneGraph in a systems::Diagram.
@param context is a context of the @p plant. The context must have the
positions of the plant set to the initialIRIS seed configuration.

increasing `options.num_collision_infeasible_samples` increases the chances that
the IRIS regions are collision free but can also significantly increase the
run-time of the algorithm. The same goes for
