@experimental

Each vertex in the graph is associated with a convex set over continuous
variables, edges in the graph contain convex costs and constraints on these
continuous variables.  We can then formulate optimization problems over this
graph, such as the shortest path problem where each visit to a vertex also
corresponds to selecting an element from the convex set subject to the costs
and constraints.  Behind the scenes, we construct efficient mixed-integer
convex transcriptions of the graph problem using MathematicalProgram.
However, we provide the option to solve an often tight convex relaxation of the
problem with GraphOfConvexSetsOptions::convex_relaxation and employ a cheap
rounding stage which solves the convex restriction along potential paths to
find a feasible solution to the original problem.

Design note: This class avoids providing any direct access to the
MathematicalProgram that it constructs nor to the decision variables /
constraints.  The users should be able to write constraints against
"placeholder" decision variables on the vertices and edges, but these get
translated in non-trivial ways to the underlying program.

@anchor nonconvex_graph_of_convex_sets
<b>Advanced Usage: Guiding Non-convex Optimization with the
%GraphOfConvexSets</b>

Solving a GCS problem using convex relaxation involves two components:
- Convex Relaxation: The relaxation of the binary variables (edge activations)
  and perspective operations on the convex cost/constraints leads to a
  convex problem that considers the graph as a whole.
- Rounding: After solving the relaxation, a randomized rounding scheme is
  applied to obtain a feasible solution for the original problem. We interpret
  the relaxed flow variables as edge probabilities to guide the maximum
  likelyhood depth first search from the source to target vertices.
  Each rounding is calling SolveConvexRestriction.

To handle non-convex constraints, one can provide convex surrogates to the
relaxation and the true non-convex constraints to the rounding problem.
These surrogates approximate the non-convex constraints, making the relaxation
solvable as a convex optimization to guide the non-convex rounding. This can be
controlled by the Transcription enum in the AddConstraint method. We
encourage users to provide a strong convex surrogate, when possible, to better
approximate the original non-convex problem.
