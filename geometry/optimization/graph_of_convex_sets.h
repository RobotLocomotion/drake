@experimental

Each vertex in the graph is associated with a convex set over continuous
variables, edges in the graph contain convex costs and constraints on these
continuous variables.  We can then formulate optimization problems over this
graph, such as the shortest path problem where each visit to a vertex also
corresponds to selecting an element from the convex set subject to the costs and
constraints.  Behind the scenes, we construct efficient mixed-integer convex
transcriptions of the graph problem using MathematicalProgram.

Design note: This class avoids providing any direct access to the
MathematicalProgram that it constructs nor to the decision variables /
constraints.  The users should be able to write constraints against
"placeholder" decision variables on the vertices and edges, but these get
translated in non-trivial ways to the underlying program.
