/** A system that publishes LCM messages compatible with the `drake_visualizer`
 application representing the current state of a SceneGraph instance (whose
 QueryObject-valued output port is connected to this system's input port).

 @system
 name: DrakeVisualizer
 input_ports:
 - query_object
 @endsystem

 The %DrakeVisualizer system broadcasts two kinds of LCM messages:

   - a message that defines the geometry in the world on the lcm channel named
     "DRAKE_VIEWER_DRAW",
   - a message that updates the poses of those geometries on the lcm channel
     named "DRAKE_VIEWER_LOAD_ROBOT"

 The system uses the versioning mechanism provided by SceneGraph to detect
 changes to the geometry so that a change in SceneGraph's data will propagate
 to `drake_visualizer`.

 @anchor drake_visualizer_role_consumer
 <h3>Visualization by Role</h3>

 By default, %DrakeVisualizer visualizes geometries with the illustration role
 (see @ref geometry_roles for more details). It can be configured to visualize
 geometries with other roles (see DrakeVisualizerParams). Only one role can be
 specified.

 The appearance of the geometry in the visualizer is typically defined by the
 the geometry's properties for the visualized role.

   - For the visualized role, if a geometry has the ("phong", "diffuse")
     property described in the table below, that value is used.
   - Otherwise, if the geometry *also* has the illustration properties, those
     properties are likewise tested for the ("phong", "diffuse") property. This
     rule only has significance is the visualized role is *not* the illustration
     role.
   - Otherwise, the configured default color will be applied (see
     DrakeVisualizerParams).

 | Group name | Required | Property Name |  Property Type  | Property Description |
 | :--------: | :------: | :-----------: | :-------------: | :------------------- |
 |    phong   | no       | diffuse       |     Rgba        | The rgba value of the object surface. |

 <h4>Appearance of OBJ files</h4>

 Meshes represented by OBJ are special. The OBJ file can reference a material
 file (.mtl). If found by `drake_visualizer`, the values in the .mtl will take
 precedence over the ("phong", "diffuse") geometry property.

 It's worth emphasizing that these rules permits control over the appearance of
 collision geometry on a per-geometry basis by assigning an explicit Rgba value
 to the ("phong", "diffuse") property in the geometry's ProximityProperties.

 @note If collision geometries are added to SceneGraph by parsing URDF/SDF
 files, they will not have diffuse values. Even if elements were added to the
 specification files, they would not be parsed. They must be added to the
 geometries after parsing.

 <h3>Effective visualization</h3>

 The best visualization is when draw messages have been preceded by a compatible
 load message (i.e., a "coherent" message sequence). While LCM doesn't guarantee
 that messages will be received/processed in the same order as they are
 broadcast, your results will be best if %DrakeVisualizer is allowed to
 broadcast coherent messages. Practices that interfere with that will likely
 produce undesirable results. E.g.,

   - Evaluating a single instance of %DrakeVisualizer across several threads,
     such that the data in the per-thread systems::Context varies.
   - Evaluating multiple instances of %DrakeVisualizer in a single thread that
     share the same lcm::DrakeLcmInterface.

 <h3>Scalar support and conversion</h3>

 %DrakeVisualizer is templated on `T` and can be used in a `double`- or
 AutoDiffXd-valued Diagram. However, the diagram can only be converted from one
 scalar type to another if the %DrakeVisualizer *owns* its
 lcm::DrakeLcmInterface instance. Attempts to scalar convert the system
 otherwise will throw an exception.
