/** A %FrameKinematicsVector is used to report kinematics data for registered
 frames (identified by unique FrameId values) to SceneGraph.
 It serves as the basis of FramePoseVector, FrameVelocityVector, and
 FrameAccelerationVector.

 The %FrameKinematicsVector must be constructed with the source's SourceId and
 the ids of the frames *owned* by the source. Once constructed, it cannot be
 resized. Typically, this will be done in the allocation method of the
 LeafSystem which serves as a geometry source.

 Populating the vector with values is a two-step process: clear and set. Before
 writing any kinematics data the vector should be _cleared_ (see clear()). After
 clearing, each registered frame will have a kinematics value assigned to it
 by calling set_value().

 Only those frame ids provided in the constructor can be set. Attempting to
 set the value for any other frame id is considered an error.
 Attempting to write more frames than the vector was constructed for is
 considered an error and will throw an exception. Failing to set data for every
 registered frame will be considered an error when the %FrameKinematicsVector
 is consumed by SceneGraph.

 <!--
   TODO: The FrameVelocityVector and FrameAccelerationVector are still to come.
  -->

 The usage of this method would be in the allocation and calculation
 of a LeafSystem's output port. The nature of the allocation depends on whether
 the source id and number of frames are available at construction or not. The
 first example shows the case where source id and frame count are known. The
 second shows the alternate, deferred case.

 ```
 template <typename T>
 class AllocInConstructorSystem : public LeafSystem<T> {
  public:
   explicit AllocInConstructorSystem(SourceId source_id)
       : source_id_(source_id) {
     ...
     // Register frames, storing ids in frame_ids_
     this->DeclareAbstractOutputPort(
         FramePoseVector<T>(source_id, frame_ids_),
         &AllocInConstructorSystem::CalcFramePoseOutput);
     ...
   }

  private:
   void CalcFramePoseOutput(const MyContext& context,
                            geometry::FramePoseVector<T>* poses) const {
     DRAKE_DEMAND(poses->source_id() == source_id_);
     DRAKE_DEMAND(poses->size() == static_cast<int>(frame_ids_.size()));

     poses->clear();
     for (int i = 0; i < static_cast<int>(frame_ids_.size()); ++i) {
       poses->set_value(frame_ids_[i], poses_[i]);
     }
   }

   SourceId source_id_;
   std::vector<FrameId> frame_ids_;
   std::vector<Isometry3<T>> poses_;
 };

 __Example 2: Deferred pose vector allocation.__

 @tparam KinematicsValue  The underlying data type of for the order of
                          kinematics data (e.g., pose, velocity, or
                          acceleration).

 One should never interact with the %FrameKinematicsVector class directly.
 Instead, the FramePoseVector, FrameVelocityVector, and FrameAccelerationVector
 classes are aliases of the %FrameKinematicsVector instantiated on specific
 data types (Isometry3, SpatialVector, and SpatialAcceleration, respectively).
 Each of these data types are templated on Eigen scalars. All supported
 combinations of data type and scalar type are already available to link against
 in the containing library. No other values for KinematicsValue are supported.

 Currently, the following data types with the following scalar types are
 supported:

  Alias           | Instantiation                            | Scalar types
 -----------------|------------------------------------------|--------------
  FramePoseVector | FrameKinematicsVector<Isometry3<Scalar>> | double
