  /** (Advanced) Specifies a thin layer of thickness "margin" (in meters) around
  each geometry. Two bodies with margins δ₁ and δ₂ are considered for contact
  resolution whenever their distance is within δ₁ + δ₂. That is, (speculative)
  contact constraints are added for objects at a distance smaller than δ₁+δ₂.

  Refer to @ref hydro_margin for further details, including theory, examples,
  recommended margin values and limitations.

  There will only be _contact_ if the two zero level sets intersect. Unless the
  zero level sets of both geometries overlap, there is no contact and no
  contact force. However, (speculative) contact constraints will be added
  allowing our discrete contact solvers to predict if a contact "will" occur at
  the next time step. This leads to additional time coherence and stability.
  Analytical studies of stability show that a value of 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm is more
  than enough for most robotics applications. This is not an
  "action-at-a-distance" trick, there is no contact when the thin margin layers
  of two objects overlap. The margin is simply a "cheap" mechanism to avoid
  significantly more complex and costly strategies such as Continuous Collision
  Detection.

  @note Inflating the geometries does not appreciably change the domain of
  contact. In the original mesh, the contact pressure is zero on the mesh's
  boundary surface. When inflating the meshes, we redefine the pressure field
  so that its zero level set field is a good approximation to the surface of
  the original geometry. When visualizing hydroelastic proximity geometry, the
  rendered geometry will include the inflation.

  @note Currently margin only applies to _compliant_ hydroelastic contact and
  it does not affect point contact. */
