/** The %QueryObject serves as a mechanism to perform geometry queries on the
 world's geometry. The SceneGraph has an abstract-valued port that contains
 a  %QueryObject (i.e., a %QueryObject-valued output port).

 To perform geometry queries on SceneGraph:
   - a LeafSystem must have a %QueryObject-valued input port and connect it to
     the corresponding query output port on SceneGraph,
   - the querying LeafSystem can evaluate the input port, retrieving a `const
     QueryObject&` in return, and, finally,
   - invoke the appropriate method on the %QueryObject.

 The const reference returned by the input port is considered "live" - it is
 linked to the context, system, and cache (making full use of all of those
 mechanisms). This const reference should _never_ be persisted; doing so can
 lead to erroneous query results. It is simpler and more advisable to acquire it
 for evaluation in a limited scope (e.g., CalcTimeDerivatives()) and then
 discard it. If a %QueryObject is needed for many separate functions in a
 LeafSystem, each should re-evaluate the input port. The underlying caching
 mechanism should make the cost of this negligible.

 In addition to not persisting the reference from the output port, the
 %QueryObject shouldn't be copied. Strictly speaking, it is an allowed
 operation, but the result is not live, and any geometry query performed on the
 copy will throw an exception.

 A %QueryObject _cannot_ be converted to a different scalar type. A %QueryObject
 of scalar type S can only be acquired from the output port of a SceneGraph
 of type S evaluated on a corresponding GeometryContext, also of type S.

 @tparam T The scalar type. Must be a valid Eigen scalar.

 Instantiated templates for the following kinds of T's are provided:

 - double
 - AutoDiffXd

 They are already available to link against in the containing library.
 No other values for T are currently supported.  */

   @anchor signed_distance_query
   @name                   Signed Distance Queries

   These queries provide φ(A, B), the signed distance between two objects A and
   B.

   If the objects do not overlap (i.e., A ⋂ B = ∅), φ > 0 and represents the
   minimal distance between the two objects. More formally:
   φ = min(|Aₚ - Bₚ|)
   ∀ Aₚ ∈ A and Bₚ ∈ B.
   @note The pair (Aₚ, Bₚ) is a "witness" of the distance.
   The pair need not be unique (think of two parallel planes).

   If the objects touch or overlap (i.e., A ⋂ B ≠ ∅), φ ≤ 0 and can be
   interpreted as the negative penetration depth. It is the smallest length of
   the vector v, such that by shifting one object along that vector relative to
   the other, the two objects will no longer be overlapping. More formally,
   φ(A, B) = -min |v|.
   s.t (Tᵥ · A) ⋂ B = ∅
   where Tᵥ is a rigid transformation that displaces A by the vector v, namely
   Tᵥ · A = {u + v | ∀ u ∈ A}.
   By implication, there exist points Aₚ and Bₚ on the surfaces of objects A and
   B, respectively, such that Aₚ + v = Bₚ, Aₚ ∈ A ∩ B, Bₚ ∈ A ∩ B. These points
   are the witnesses to the penetration.

   This method is affected by collision filtering; geometry pairs that
   have been filtered will not produce signed distance query results.

   @note the signed distance function is a continuous function with respect to
   the pose of the objects.
