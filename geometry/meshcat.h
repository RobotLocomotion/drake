Each instance of this class spawns a thread which runs an http/websocket server.
Users can navigate their browser to the hosted URL to visualize the Meshcat
scene.  Note that, unlike many visualizers, one cannot open the visualizer until
this server is running.

@warning In the current implementation, Meshcat methods must be called from the
same thread where the class instance was constructed.  For example, running
multiple simulations in parallel using the same Meshcat instance is not yet
supported. We may generalize this in the future.

@section meshcat_path Meshcat paths and the scene tree

https://github.com/rdeits/meshcat#api provides a nice introduction to the
websocket API that we wrap with this class.  One of the core concepts is the
"scene tree" -- a directory-like structure of objects, transforms, and
properties. The scene tree is viewable in the browser by clicking on "Open
Controls" in the top right corner.

Elements of the tree are referenced programmatically by a "/"-delimited string
indicating the object's **path** in the scene tree. An object at path "/foo/bar"
is a child of an object at path "/foo", so setting the transform of (or
deleting) "/foo" will also affect its children.

The string path arguments to the methods in this class use the following
semantics:
- A path that begins with "/" is treated as an absolute path, and is used
without modification.
- A path that *does not* begin with "/" is treated as a relative path to the
default working directory.
- The "working directory" is fixed to be "/drake" in the current implementation.
So any relative path "foo" will be treated as "/drake/foo".
- Delete("/foo") will remove all objects, transforms, and properties in "/foo"
and its children from the scene tree.
- Delete() is equivalent to Delete("") or Delete("/drake/").
- SetObject("/foo", ...) places the object at "/foo/<object>", where "<object>"
is a hard-coded suffix used for all objects.  You can use the
Delete("/foo/<object>") to delete the object only (and not the children of
"/foo") and must use SetProperty("/foo/<object>", ...) to change object-specific
properties.

The root directory contains a number of elements that are set up automatically
in the browser.  These include "/Background", "/Lights", "/Grid", and
"/Cameras".  To find more details please see the @link
https://github.com/rdeits/meshcat#api meshcat documentation @endlink and the
@link https://threejs.org/docs/index.html three.js documentation @endlink.
- You can modify these elements, create new lights/cameras, and even delete
these elements (one at a time).
- Delete("/") is not allowed.  It will be silently ignored.

@section meshcat_recommended_workflow Recommended workflow

For convenience, Meshcat fosters a work flow in which all user-created objects
created in Drake are contained in the "/drake" folder. Objects added with a
relative path are placed in the "/drake" folder for you. The benefits are:
- It's simple to distinguish between user objects and "infrastructure" objects
in the visualizer.
- All user objects can easily be cleared by a single, parameter-free call to
Delete(). You are welcome to use absolute paths to organize your data, but the
burden on tracking and cleaning them up lie on you.
