/** Dynamical system representation of a rod contacting a half-space in
two dimensions.

<h3>Notation</h3>
In the discussion below and in code comments, we will use the 2D analog of our
standard multibody notation as described in detail here:
@ref multibody_notation.
<!-- http://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__notation.html -->

For a quick summary and translation to 2D:
 - When we combine rotational and translational quantities into a single
   quantity in 3D, we call those "spatial" quantities. In 2D those combined
   quantities are actually planar, but we will continue to refer to them as
   "spatial" to keep the notation analogous and promote easy extension of 2D
   pedagogical examples to 3D.
 - We use capital letters to represent bodies and coordinate frames. Frame F has
   an origin point Fo, and a basis formed by orthogonal unit vector axes Fx and
   Fy, with an implicit `Fz=Fx × Fy` always pointing out of the screen for a 2D
   system. The inertial frame World is W, and the rod frame is R.
 - We also use capitals to represent points, and we allow a frame name F to be
   used where a point is expected to represent its origin Fo.
 - We use `p_CD` to represent the position vector from point C to point D. Note
   that if A and B are frames, `p_AB` means `p_AoBo`.
 - If we need to be explicit about the expressed-in frame F for any quantity, we
   add the suffix `_F` to its symbol. So the position vector from C to D,
   expressed in W, is `p_CD_W`.
 - R_AB is the rotation matrix giving frame B's orientation in frame A.
 - X_AB is the transformation matrix giving frame B's pose in frame A, combining
   both a rotation and a translation; this is conventionally called a
   "transform". A transform is a spatial quantity.

In 2D, with frames A and B the above quantities are (conceptually) matrices
with the indicated dimensions: <pre>
    p_AB = Bo-Ao = |x|      R_AB=| cθ -sθ |       X_AB=| R_AB p_AB |
                   |y|₂ₓ₁        | sθ  cθ |₂ₓ₂         | 0  0   1  |₃ₓ₃
</pre>
where x,y are B's Cartesian coordinates in the A frame, and θ is the
counterclockwise angle from Ax to Bx, measured about Az (and Bz). In practice,
2D rotations are represented just by the scalar angle θ, and 2D transforms are
represented by (x,y,θ).

We use v for translational velocity of a point and w (ω) for rotational
velocity of a frame. The symbols are:
 - `v_AP` is point P's velocity in frame A, expressed in frame A if no
   other frame is given as a suffix.
 - `w_AB` is frame B's angular velocity in frame A, expressed in frame A
   if no other frame is given as a suffix.
 - `V_AB` is frame B's spatial velocity in A, meaning `v_ABo` and `w_AB`.


These quantities are conceptually: <pre>
    v_AB = |vx|      w_AB=|0|       V_AB=| w_AB |
           |vy|           |0|            | v_AB |₆ₓ₁
           | 0|₃ₓ₁        |ω|₃ₓ₁
</pre>
but in 2D we represent translational velocity with just (vx,vy), angular
velocity with just the scalar w=ω=@f$\dot{\theta}@f$ (that is, d/dt θ), and
spatial velocity as (vx,vy,ω).

Forces f and torques τ are represented similarly:
 - `f_P` is an in-plane force applied to a point P fixed to some rigid body.
 - `t_A` is an in-plane torque applied to frame A (meaning it is about Az).
 - `F_A` is a spatial force including both `f_Ao` and `t_A`.

The above symbols can be suffixed with an expressed-in frame if the frame is
not already obvious, so `F_A_W` is a spatial force applied to frame A (at Ao)
but expressed in W. These quantities are conceptually: <pre>
    f_A = |fx|      t_A=|0|       F_A=| t_A |
          |fy|          |0|           | f_A |₆ₓ₁
          | 0|₃ₓ₁       |τ|₃ₓ₁
</pre>
but in 2D we represent translational force with just (fx,fy), torque with just
the scalar t=τ, and spatial force as (fx,fy,τ).

<h3>The 2D rod model</h3>
The rod's coordinate frame R is placed at the rod's center point Ro, which
is also its center of mass Rcm. R's planar pose is given by a planar
transform X_WR=(x,y,θ). When X_WR=0 (identity transform), R is coincident
with the World frame W, and aligned horizontally as shown: <pre>

       +Wy                                  +Ry
        |                                    |
        |                                    |<---- h ----->
        |                      ==============|==============
      Wo*-----> +Wx         Rl*            Ro*-----> +Rx    *Rr
                               =============================
       World frame                      Rod R, θ=0
</pre>
θ is the angle between Rx and Wx, measured using the right hand rule about
Wz (out of the screen), that is, counterclockwise. The rod has half-length
h, and "left" and "right" endpoints `Rl=Ro-h*Rx` and `Rr=Ro+h*Rx` at which
it can contact the halfspace whose surface is at Wy=0.

This system can be simulated using one of three models:
- continuously, using a compliant contact model (the rod is rigid, but contact
  between the rod and the half-space is modeled as compliant) simulated using
  ordinary differential equations (ODEs),
- a fully rigid model simulated with piecewise differential algebraic
  equations (DAEs), and
- a fully rigid model simulated as a discrete system using a first-order
  discretization approach.

The rod state is initialized to the configuration that corresponds to the
Painlevé Paradox problem, described in [Stewart 2000]. The paradox consists
of a rod contacting a planar surface *without impact* and subject to sliding
Coulomb friction. The problem is well known to correspond to an
*inconsistent rigid contact configuration*, where impulsive forces are
necessary to resolve the problem.

This class uses Drake's `-inl.h` pattern.  When seeing linker errors from
this class, please refer to http://drake.mit.edu/cxx_inl.html.

@tparam T The vector element type, which must be a valid Eigen scalar.

Instantiated templates for the following scalar types @p T are provided:
- double

They are already available to link against in the containing library.

Inputs: planar force (two-dimensional) and torque (scalar), which are
        arbitrary "external" forces (expressed in the world frame) applied
        at the center-of-mass of the rod.

States: planar position (state indices 0 and 1) and orientation (state
        index 2), and planar linear velocity (state indices 3 and 4) and
        scalar angular velocity (state index 5) in units of m, radians,
        m/s, and rad/s, respectively. Orientation is measured counter-
        clockwise with respect to the x-axis. 

Outputs: Output Port 0 corresponds to the state vector; Output Port 1
         corresponds to a PoseVector giving the 3D pose of the rod in the world
         frame.
