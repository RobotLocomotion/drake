/// Solves constraint problems for constraint forces. Specifically, given
/// problem data corresponding to a rigid or multi-body system constrained
/// bilaterally and/or unilaterally and acted upon by friction, this class
/// computes the constraint forces.
///
/// This problem can be formulated as a mixed linear complementarity problem
/// (MLCP)- for 2D problems with Coulomb friction or 3D problems without Coulomb
/// friction- or a mixed complementarity problem (for 3D problems with
/// Coulomb friction). We use a polygonal approximation (of selectable accuracy)
/// to the friction cone, which yields a MLCP in all cases.
///
/// Existing algorithms for solving MLCPs, which are based upon algorithms for
/// solving "pure" linear complementarity problems (LCPs), solve smaller classes
/// of problems than the corresponding LCP versions. For example, Lemke's
/// Algorithm, which is provably able to solve the impacting problems covered by
/// this class, can solve LCPs with copositive matrices [Cottle 1992] but MLCPs
/// with only positive semi-definite matrices (the latter is a strict subset of
/// the former) [Sargent 1978].
///
/// Rather than using one of these MLCP algorithms, we instead transform the
/// problem into a pure LCP by first solving for the bilateral constraint
/// forces. This method yields an implication of which the user should be aware.
/// Bilateral constraint forces are computed before unilateral constraint
/// forces: the constraint forces will not be evenly distributed between
/// bilateral and unilateral constraints (assuming such a distribution were even
/// possible).
///
/// For the normal case of unilateral constraints admitting degrees of
/// freedom, the solution methods in this class support "softening" of the
/// constraints, as described in [Lacoursiere 2007] via the constraint force
/// mixing (CFM) and error reduction parameter (ERP) parameters that are now
/// ubiquitous in game multi-body dynamics simulation libraries.

  /// is semi-implicit and models compliant contact efficiently, including both
  /// sticking contact and contact between very stiff surfaces; 2) all
  /// constraint forces are computed in Newtons (typical "time stepping
  /// methods" require considerable care to correctly compare constraint forces,
  /// which are impulsive, and non-constraint forces, which are non-impulsive);
  /// and 3) can be made almost symplectic by choosing a
  /// representation and computational coordinate frame that minimize
  /// velocity-dependent forces (thereby explaining the extreme stability of
  /// software like ODE and Bullet that computes dynamics in body frames
  /// (minimizing the magnitudes of velocity-dependent forces) and provides
  /// the ability to disable gyroscopic forces.
  ///
  /// The discretization problem replaces the meaning of v⁻ and v⁺ in the MLCP
  /// to mean the generalized velocity at time t and the generalized velocity
  /// at time t+h, respectively, for discretization quantum h (or, equivalently,
  /// integration step size h).  The LCP is adjusted to the form:<pre>
  /// MM ≡ | hNCNᵀ+γᴺ  hNCDᵀ   0   hNCLᵀ    |
  ///      | hDCNᵀ     hDCDᵀ   E   hDCLᵀ    |

  ///      | hLCNᵀ     hLCDᵀ   0   hLCLᵀ+γᴸ |

  ///      | kᴰ - |D 0ⁿᵛ⁺ⁿᵇ|A⁻¹a |
  ///      |       0             |
  ///      | kᴸ - |L 0ⁿᵛ⁺ⁿᵇ|A⁻¹a |</pre>
  /// where `γᴺ`, `γᴸ`, `kᴺ`, `kᴸ`, and `a` are all functions of `h`;
  /// documentation that describes how to update these (and dependent) problem
  /// data to attain desired constraint stiffness and dissipation is
  /// forthcoming.
  ///
  /// The procedure one uses to formulate and solve this discretization problem
  /// is:
  /// -# Call ConstructBaseDiscretizedTimeLcp()
  /// -# Select an integration step size, dt
  /// -# Compute `kᴺ` and `kᴸ` in the problem data, accounting for dt as
  ///    necessary
  /// -# Call UpdateDiscretizedTimeLcp(), obtaining MM and qq that encode the
  ///    linear complementarity problem
  /// -# Solve the linear complementarity problem
  /// -# If LCP solved, quit.
  /// -# Reduce dt and repeat the process from 3. until success.
