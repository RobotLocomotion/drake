Robotic Manipulation
====================

This directory contains a C++ implementation of the ManipulationStation Diagram
originally designed to support the Robotic Manipulation class at MIT.

Course website: https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu

The course no longer uses this C++ version; we now set up the
ManipulationStation completely in Python so that it is easier for students to
modify. That Python implementation can be found in the online notebooks
available from the course website linked above.
