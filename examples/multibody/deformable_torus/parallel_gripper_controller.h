 gripper to follow a close-lift-open motion sequence. The desired position is
 2-dimensional with the first element corresponding to the wrist degree of
 freedom and the second element corresponding to the left finger degree of
 freedom. This control is a time-based state machine, where desired state
 changes based on the context time. There are four states, executed in the
 following order:

  0. The fingers are open in the initial state.
  1. The fingers are closed to secure a grasp.
  2. The gripper is lifted to a prescribed final height.
  3. The fingers are open to loosen the grasp.

 The desired state is interpolated between these states. */
