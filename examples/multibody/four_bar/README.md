# Four-Bar Linkage Example
This planar four-bar linkage demonstrates how to use a bushing to
approximate a closed kinematic chain. It loads an SDF model from the
file "four_bar.sdf" into MultiBodyPlant. It handles the closed kinematic
chain by replacing one of the four-bar's revolute (pin) joints with a
bushing ([drake::multibody::LinearBushingRollPitchYaw](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_linear_bushing_roll_pitch_yaw.html))
whose force stiffness and damping values were approximated as discussed below.
An alternative way to close this four-bar's kinematic chain is to "cut"
one of the four-bar's rigid links in half and join those halves with a
bushing that has both force and torque stiffness/damping. Note: the links
in this example are constrained to rigid motion in the world X-Z
plane (bushing X-Y plane) by the 3 revolute joints specified in the
SDF. Therefore it is not necessary for the bushing to have force
stiffness/damping along the joint axis.

To run with default flags:

```
bazel run //examples/multibody/four_bar:passive_simulation
```

You should see the four-bar model oscillating passively with a small initial
velocity.

To change the initial velocity of `joint_WA`, qÃáA in radians/second :
```
bazel run //examples/multibody/four_bar:passive_simulation -- --initial_velocity=<desired_velocity>
```

You can also apply a constant torque, ùêì·¥Ä, to `joint_WA` with a command line
argument:
```
bazel run //examples/multibody/four_bar:passive_simulation -- --applied_torque=<desired_torque>
```
The torque is applied constantly to the joint actuator with no feedback. Thus,
 if set high enough, you will see the system become unstable. 

You can change the bushing parameters from the command line to observe their
effect on
the modeled joint. For instance, change `force_stiffness` to 300:
 ```
bazel run //examples/multibody/four_bar:passive_simulation -- --force_stiffness=300
```
And observe a gradual displacement between link *B* and link *C*.

Change `force_damping` to 0:
 ```
bazel run //examples/multibody/four_bar:passive_simulation -- --force_damping=0
```
And observe the joint oscillating.

Try setting `applied_torque` to 1000 and watch how the large forces interact
with the bushing stiffness.


## Four-bar linkage model

The figure below shows a planar four-bar linkage consisting of 
frictionless-pin-connected uniform rigid links *A, B, C* and ground-link *W*.
- Link *A* connects to *W* and *B* at points *A*‚Çí and *B*‚Çí
- Link *B* connects to *A* and *C* at points *B*‚Çí and *B*c

With ùêì·¥Ä = 0, the equilibrium values for the angles are:
ùê™·¥Ä ‚âà 75.52¬∞, ùê™ ô ‚âà 104.48¬∞, ùê™·¥Ñ ‚âà 104.48¬∞.

## Starting Configuration

The SDF defines all of the links with their x axes parallel to the world x
axis for convenience of measuring the angles in the state of the system
with respect to a fixed axis. Below we derive a valid initial configuration
of the three angles ùê™·¥Ä, ùê™ ô, and ùê™·¥Ñ.

| Derivation of starting configuration |
| :---: |

| |

Due to equal link lengths, the initial condition (static equilibrium) 
forms an isosceles trapezoid and initial values can be determined from
trigonometry. ùê™·¥Ä is one angle of a right triangle with its adjacent
side measuring 1 m and its hypotenuse measuring 4 m.  Hence, initially
ùê™·¥Ä = tan‚Åª¬π(‚àö15) ‚âà 1.318 radians ‚âà 75.52¬∞.

Because link *B* is parallel to **WÃÇ**ùê±, ùê™·¥Ä and ùê™ ô are supplementary,
hence the initial value is ùê™ ô = œÄ - ùê™·¥Ä ‚âà 1.823 radians ‚âà  104.48¬∞.
Similarly, ùê™·¥Ä and ùê™·¥Ñ are supplementary, so initially ùê™·¥Ñ = ùê™ ô. 

# Modeling the revolute joint between links B and C with a bushing

In this example, we replace the pin joint at point **Bc** (see diagram)
that connects links *B* and *C* with a
[drake::multibody::LinearBushingRollPitchYaw](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_linear_bushing_roll_pitch_yaw.html)
(there are many other uses of a bushing).  We model a z-axis revolute joint by
setting torque stiffness constant k‚ÇÇ = 0 and  torque damping constant d‚ÇÇ = 0.
We chose the z-axis (Yaw) to avoid a singularity associated with "gimbal lock".
Two frames (one attached to *B* called `Bc_Bushing` with origin at point
**Bc** and one attached to *C* called `Cb_Bushing` with origin at point
**Cb**) are oriented so their z-axes are perpedicular to the planar
four-bar linkage.

## Estimating bushing parameters
Joints are normally modeled with hard constraints except in their motion
direction, and three of the four revolute joints here are indeed modeled
that way. However, in order to close the kinematic loop we have to use a
bushing as a "penalty method" substitute for hard constraints. That is, because
the bushing is compliant it will violate the constraint to some degree. The
stiffer we make it, the more precisely it will enforce the constraint but
the more difficult the problem will be to solve numerically. We want to
choose stiffness k and damping d for the bushing to balance those
considerations. First, consider your tolerance for constraint errors -- if
the joint allows deviations of 1mm (say) would that be OK for your application?
Similarly, would angular errors of 1 degree (say) be tolerable? We will give
a procedure below for estimating a reasonable value of k to achieve a
specified translational and rotational tolerance. Also, we need to choose
d to damp out oscillations caused by the stiff spring in a "reasonable" time.
Consider a time scale you would consider negligible. Perhaps a settling time
of 1ms (say) would be ignorable for your robot arm, which presumably has
much larger time constants for important behaviors. We will give a
procedure here for obtaining a reasonable d from k and your settling
time tolerance. For a more detailed discussion on choosing bushing parameters
for a variety of its uses, see [drake::multibody::LinearBushingRollPitchYaw](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1multibody_1_1_linear_bushing_roll_pitch_yaw.html).

### Estimate force stiffness [kx ky kz] from loading/displacement
The bushing's force stiffness constants [kx ky kz] can be
approximated via various methods (or a combination thereof).
For example, one could specify a maximum bushing displacement in a
direction (e.g.,  x‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì), estimate a maximum directional load (Fx) that
combines gravity forces, applied forces, inertia forces (centripetal,
Coriolus, gyroscopic), and then calculate kx ‚âà Fx /  x‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì.

### Estimate force stiffness [kx ky kz] constants from mass and œâ‚Çô
The bushing's force stiffness constants [kx ky kz] can be
approximated via a related linear constant-coefficient 2‚Åø·µà-order ODE:

|  |  |
| ----- | ---- |
|  m xÃà +     d‚Çì xÃá +  k‚Çì x = 0  |  or alternatively as |
|    xÃà + 2 Œ∂ œâ‚Çô xÃá + œâ‚Çô¬≤ x = 0  |  where œâ‚Çô = ‚àö(k‚Çì/m),  Œ∂ = dx / (2 ‚àö(m k‚Çì)) |

Values for k‚Çì can be determined by choosing a characteristic mass m
(which may be directionally dependent) and then choosing œâ‚Çô > 0
(speed of response). Rearranging œâ‚Çô = ‚àö(k‚Çì/m) produces k‚Çì = m œâ‚Çô¬≤.
One way to choose œâ‚Çô is to choose a settling time t‚Çõ which
approximates the desired time for stretch x to settle to within 1% (0.01)
of an equilibrium solution, and choose a damping ratio Œ∂ (e.g., Œ∂ = 1,
critical damping), then calculate œâ‚Çô = -ln(0.01) / (Œ∂ t‚Çõ) ‚âà 4.6 / (Œ∂ t‚Çõ).
For the included example code, a characteristic mass m = 20 kg was chosen
with t‚Çõ = 0.12 and Œ∂ = 1 (critical damping). Thus
œâ‚Çô = -ln(0.01) / 0.12 ‚âà 38.38 and k‚Çì = (20)*(38.38)¬≤ ‚âà 30000.

### Estimate force damping [dx dy dz] from mass and stiffness 
Once m and k‚Çì have been chosen, damping d‚Çì can be estimated by picking a
damping ratio Œ∂ (e.g., Œ∂ ‚âà 1, critical damping), then d‚Çì ‚âà 2 Œ∂ ‚àö(m kx).
For our example d‚Çì ‚âà 2¬∑‚àö(20¬∑30000) ‚âà 1500.

### Estimating torque stiffness [k‚ÇÄ k‚ÇÅ k‚ÇÇ] and damping [d‚ÇÄ d‚ÇÅ d‚ÇÇ]
The bushing in this planar example replaces a revolute joint. The links are
constrained to planar motion by the existing joints, hence no
torque stiffness nor torque damping is needed.  An alternative way to
deal with this four-bar's closed kinematic loop is to "cut" one of the
four-bar's rigid links in half and join those halves with a bushing
that has both force and torque stiffness/damping.  If this technique
is used, torque stiffness is needed.  One way to approximate torque
stiffness is with concepts similar to the force stiffness above.
For example, the bushing's torque stiffness k‚ÇÄ could be calculated
by specifing a maximum bushing angular displacement Œ∏‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì, estimating
a maximum moment load Mx and calculating k‚ÇÄ = Mx / Œ∏‚Çò‚Çê‚Çì.
Alternatively, a value for k‚ÇÄ can be determined by choosing a
characteristic moment of inertia I‚ÇÄ (which is directionally dependent)
and then choosing œâ‚Çô (e.g., from setting time), then using k‚ÇÄ ‚âà I‚ÇÄ œâ‚Çô¬≤.
With k‚ÇÄ available and a damping ratio Œ∂ chosen, d‚ÇÄ ‚âà 2 Œ∂ ‚àö(I‚ÇÄ k‚ÇÄ).
