    <!--
    This sdf file produces a model of a planar four bar linkage.
    See the README for more details on the modelling done in this file.

    We replace one of the 4 revolute joints with a model revolute joint
    implemented with a LinearBushingRollPitchYaw ForceElement in the code.
    This SDF provides the frames at which to place the above mentioned bushing.

    Links A, B, C, and (the implicit) World link complete the closed kinematic
    chain.

    Links A, B, C have length 4 m and mass 20 kg and in 3D are modeled
    by boxes with dimensions (4.2 m, 0.1 m, 0.2 m).

    For each link we define a frame: A, B, C, and W.

              Wz
              ^
              |
   Wx  <- - - ·

   Frame W is the implicit world link with Wo its origin, Wz pointing up, Wx
   pointing left, and Wy pointing out of the page. Gravity points in the -Wz
   direction.

   In the zero configuration, frame A is coincident with frame W. In other
   words X_WA is the identity.
   The Ax axis points along the link.

   Frame B is defined relative to A.
   The origin of the B frame measured in A, p_AB, is (-4, 0, 0)
   In the zero configuration, frame B's orientation measured in A, R_AB,
   is the identity.
   The Bx axis points along the link.

   Frame C is defined relative to W.
   The origin of the C frame measured in the world, p_WC, is (-2, 0, 0).
   In the zero configuration, frame C's orientation measured in the world,
   R_WC, is the identity.
   The Cx axis points along the link.

   In pseudo code, the frames in the zero configuration can be written:
   X_WA = RigidTransformd::Identity();
   X_AB = RigidTransformd(Vector3d(4, 0, 0));
   X_WC = RigidTransformd(Vector3d(-2, 0, 0));

   For each link, we also define a revolute joint, located at the
   origin of that link's frame, oriented along the world's y-axis.

   joint_WA is the y-axis revolute joint between the parent world and the child A.
   joint_WA's joint angle is denoted q_WA.

   joint_AB is the y-axis revolute joint between the parent A and the child B.
   joint_AB's joint angle is denoted q_AB.

   joint_WC is the y-axis revolute joint between the parent world and the child B.
   joint_WC's joint angle is denoted q_WC.

   There is no joint connecting link B to link C. We will model a
   revolute joint between them with a LinearBushingRollPitchYaw ForceElement in
   the code. For this we define two frames:
   Bc_bushing is a frame attached to link B.
   Cb_bushing is a frame attached to link C.
   See their definition below for the details of how they are defined.

   In the default configuration (i.e. q_WA = q_AB = q_WC = 0) all of the links
   lie flat along the Wx axis. Note this is not a valid configuration that
   satisfies loop closure. However, they are defined in such a way to make
   this SDF readable and so at least q_WA and q_WC are measured relative to a
   fixed axis of the world frame. Please see the README for a detailed
   diagram with configuration angles that satisfy the loop closure equation.
