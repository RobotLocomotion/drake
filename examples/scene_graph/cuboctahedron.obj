# Cuboctahedron centered at origin with edge length sqrt(2) and width of 2.0.
# It fits inside the cube [-1,+1]^3. It has 6 square faces (same as a cube), and
# 8 triangular faces (same as an octahedron). It is a hybrid between a cube and
# an octahedron. Every face has edges of the same length sqrt(2).

# 12 coordinates generated by:
# step 1. assign coordinate c = x, y, or z to be 0 (3 choices)
# step 2. remaining two coordinates are the extrema -1 or +1 (2x2 = 4 choices)
# 3 (step 1) x 4 (step 2) = 12 choices
# (  x,   y,   z)
# (  0, +-1, +-1)
# (+-1,   0, +-1)
# (+-1, +-1,   0)

# These points are the midpoints of the 12 edges of the bounding cube [-1,+1]^3.

# We have 8 triangular faces. One triangle for each vertex of the cube [-1,1]^3.
# step 1. pick one corner (+-1, +-1, +-1) of the cube
# step 2. replace one of the x,y,z by 0 to get 3 vertices of the triangle
