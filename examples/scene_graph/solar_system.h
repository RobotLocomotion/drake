/** A model of an orrery -- a simple mechanical model of the solar system.

 The orrery contains one sun and six orbiting bodies: two planets (Earth and
 Mars) each with one moon and two satellites for Earth. The orrery is
 articulated by placing the _frame_ for each body at its parent's origin, and
 then displacing the geometry from that origin to its orbital distance. Then
 each orbiting frame has a single degree of freedom: its angular position
 around its axis of rotation.

 - The sun is stationary -- an anchored geometry.
 - Earth orbits on the xy-plane. Its moon (Luna) revolves around the earth on
   a different arbitrary plane (illustrating transform compositions).
 - Two satellites (Convex and Box) revolve around Earth in the same way as
   Luna but at different relative angular positions around their axis of
   rotation.
 - Mars orbits the sun at a farther distance on a plane that is tilted off of
   the xy-plane. Its moon (Phobos) orbits around Mars on a plane parallel to
   Mars's orbital plane, but in the opposite direction.
 - Mars has been given an arbitrary set of rings posed askew. The rings are
   declared as a child of mars's geometry.

 This system illustrates the following features:

 1. Registering anchored geometry.
 2. Registering frames as children of other frames.
 3. Allocating and calculating the FramePoseVector output for visualization.
 4. Exercise all supported SceneGraph geometries in an illustration context.

 perpendicular to the plane of the circle.
