This branch contains a file which lists all experimental CI jobs that
correspond to a production job, in the form of requests to execute those
jobs on a pull request. The file is separated into two lists: "provisioned"
jobs use an already-set-up build environment, while "unprovisioned" jobs run
from a clean environment.
