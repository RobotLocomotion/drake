/**
 A class containing information regarding contact and contact response between
 two geometries attached to a pair of bodies. This class provides the output
 from the Hydroelastic contact model and includes:

    - The shared contact surface between the two geometries, which includes
      the virtual pressures acting at every point on the contact surface.
    - The spatial force from the integrated tractions that is applied at the
      centroid of the contact surface.

 The two geometries, denoted M and N (and obtainable via
 `contact_surface().id_M()` and `contact_surface().id_N()`) are attached to
 bodies A and B, respectively.

 When T = Expression, the class is specialized to not contain any member data,
 because ContactSurface doesn't support Expression.

   force.

   The geometry::ContactSurface defines contact between two geometries M and N
   (via contact_surface().id_M() and contact_surface().id_N(), respectively).
   %HydroelasticContactInfo further associates geometries M and N with the
   bodies to which they are rigidly fixed, A and B, respectively. It is the
   responsibility of the caller of this constructor to ensure that the
   parameters satisfy the documented invariants, see below. Similarly, the
   spatial force `F_Ac_W` must be provided as indicated by the monogram notation
   in use, that is, it is the spatial force on body A, at the contact surface's
   centroid C, and expressed in the world frame.

   @param[in] contact_surface Contact surface between two geometries M and N,
     see geometry::ContactSurface::id_M() and geometry::ContactSurface::id_N().
     This must point to immutable data (i.e., data that will never change),
     and must not be nullptr.
   @param[in] F_Ac_W Spatial force applied on body A, at contact surface
     centroid C, and expressed in the world frame W. The position `p_WC` of C in
     the world frame W can be obtained with
