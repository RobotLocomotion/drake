@section solid_mechanics Mechanics of Solids

All objects in real life are compliant and deform under the action of external
loads. Deformations, as well as motion, of real life solids are well described
by the theory of _continuum mechanics_, which provides a complete description
of the full three-dimensional state of stress and deformation given a set of
external loads and boundary conditions.
Broadly, how compliant a solid is depends on the material (or materials) it is
made of. Factors such as microstructure, imperfections, anisotropy, etc. affect
the behavior of a material. Ultimately, in continuum mechanics, the behavior of
a particular material can be boiled down to its stress-strain curve,
or constitutive law describing the stress/strain relationship at each point
within a solid composed of that material. The simplest constitutive law is that
of Hooke's law, describing the behaviour of materials which exhibit a
linear-elastic region in the stress-strain curve. Materials such as steel and
aluminum can be modeled as Hookean, as long as strain is within the elastic
range (< 1% strain for steel for example). Other materials such as rubber are
hyperelastic and are best described by a Neo-Hookean law.
The _stiffness_ of a material essentially refers to how steep this
stress-strain curve is. The steeper the slope of the stress-strain curve, the
stiffer a material is. For Hookean materials, this translates to a larger
Young's modulus (the slope of the stress-strain curve in the linear regime).


@section contact_mechanics Contact Mechanics

Contact mechanics refers to the study of the deformations that solids undergo as
the result of contact loads. The study of contact mechanics dates back to the
pioneering work of Heinrich Hertz in 1882. The Hertzian theory of contact
describes the loads and deformations when strains are small, the contacting
surfaces are much smaller than the overall dimensions of the contacting bodies
and the materials are linear (i.e. are described by the Hookean law).

In general, when two solids come into contact, they inevitably must undergo
deformation in order to avoid the physical impossibility of interpenetration.
This constraint is described by the Signorini boundary condition, which at each
point in the contact surface imposes a complementarity constraint between
normal stress and penetration (described by a gap function).
Stresses on the contact surface are the result of these deformations.

Ultimately, contact forces are the result of integrating these contact
stresses on the contact surface between the solids.

@section rigid_approximation Rigid Approximation of Contact

A rigid body is an _approximation_ to the general mechanics of solids in the
mathematical limit to infinite stiffness.
This mathematical approximation has been used extensively in the past for the
simulation of multibody systems with contact. As an approximation to the real
physical system, it leads to known problems such as indeterminate systems.
Consider for instance a rigid beam supported by its two end points and by a
third point of support right in the middle, through its center of gravity. Under
the action of its own weight, infinite solutions to the static problem exist.

Rigid contact with Coulomb friction is a common approximation used in
simulation as well. It has its own limitations, most notable the possible
non-existence of a solution. An example of this is the well known Painlevé
paradox @ref PfeifferGlocker1996 "[Pfeiffer & Glocker, 1996]", a one degree of
freedom system with only one contact that, depending on the state, has an
infinite number of solutions or even no solution.

It should be noted that these artifacts are a consequence of the mathematical
approximations adopted and not a flaw of the original continuum mechanics theory
and even much less, a flaw in the physics itself.

@section why_rigid Why so Rigid? Embracing Compliance

The rigid modeling of contact coupled with Coulomb friction is plagued with a
wide variety of technical issues:
 - Even without friction, the system can be overconstrained and the contact
   forces are indeterminate.
 - As described above, rigid contact coupled with Coulomb friction might lead to
   the Painlevé paradox, where the system has no solution or infinite solutions.
 - Simulating these systems requires the formulation of Non-Linear
   Complementarity problems (NCPs).  NCPs are believed to be NP-hard
   @ref Kaufman2008 "[Kaufman et al., 2008]" (i.e. very difficult to deal with
   in practice) and are often very ill conditioned numerically, leading to
   brittle solutions in practical software.

The literature on this topic is very rich, and there has been a great deal of
effort to solve many of these problems. Unfortunately, most solutions involve
the introduction of heuristics or tuning parameters hidden within the solvers
that introduce yet new artifacts or trading off robustness/speed for physical
accuracy.

As an example, *constraint softening* is introduced "...to control the
sponginess and springiness..." (quoting from the @ref ODEUserGuide
"[ODE User Guide]"). This strategy is used to improve the numerics of the
solver, which no longer approximates a true rigid system, but a compliant one.
Similarly, Interior Point (IP) methods for general NCPs or more recently
Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) in @ref Li2020 "[Li et al., 2020]",
introduce barrier functions to handle constraints. These barriers can only be
solved to a finite accuracy, at which the solution is essentially compliant
(even if stiff). This is discussed in more detail in
@ref Castro2023 "[Castro et al., 2023]".

@subsection compliance_in_robotics Compliance in Robotics

Many robots are actually compliant in the real hardware --- robotic grippers and
fingers are padded to improve grasping efficiency, and robot feet as those
commonly found in quadrupeds and humanoid robots have rubber surfaces.
Therefore, compliance *must* be modeled if our goal is physical accuracy to
close the sim2real gap.

@subsection embracing_compliance Embracing Compliance

The discussion above can be probably summarized as follows:
 1. The rigid approximation of contact leads to fundamental problems in the
    mathematics and ill-conditioned numerics in software.
 2. Real physical systems are compliant, even if stiff.
 3. Numerical techniques to deal with ill conditioning essentially boil down to
    introducing compliance at some level deep within the solver.

It is for these reasons that in Drake we embrace compliance, to provide accurate
modeling of the physics of contact but also as a means to mitigate numerical
problems associated with rigid approximations of contact. Within this framework,
<em>rigid contact</em> can be approximated with very stiff compliance. As shown
in @ref Castro2023 "[Castro et al., 2023]" this technique is very effective even
at very high stiffness values, beyond what it is really needed to model hard
materials such as steel. In this way the modeling of contact is transparent to
users, with physical parameters to control compliance and no need for hidden
parameters in our solvers.

@section compliant_point_contact Compliant Point Contact

The point contact model defines the contact force by determining the minimum
translational displacement (MTD). The minimum translational displacement is the
smallest relative displacement between two volumes that will take them from
intersecting to just touching. This quantity need not be unique (if two spheres
have coincident centers, any direction will serve). Once we have this
displacement, we get three quantities that we use to define the contact force:
  - The direction of the displacement vector is the contact normal.
  - The magnitude is a measure of the amount of penetration (and is correlated
    with the magnitude of the normal component of the contact force).
  - Two witness points for the MTD. The witness points comprise one point on
    the surface of each volume such that when we apply the minimum
    translational displacement, they are coincident. We use the witness points
    (and other physical parameters) to define the point at which the contact
    force is applied.

This model is simple to implement and cheap to compute, but has some drawbacks.

- A single measure of “maximum penetration” cannot distinguish between a large
  intersecting volume and a small intersecting volume (see Figure 1). The two
  intersections would produce the same amount of contact force despite the fact
  that one is clearly compressing more material.

- Contact along a large interface is treated as contact at a single point (see
  Figure 2). Effects that depend on a contact interface over a domain with
  non-zero area disappear (e.g., torsional friction).

- The witness points are not necessarily unique. This means,
  generally, there is no guarantee that the witness points will be consistent
  from frame to frame, which means that the point at which the force is applied
  will not be consistent. This can produce non-physical artifacts like sudden
  changes in force direction.

@subsection point_forces_modeling Modeling of Forces

Given the "maximum penetration" x, we compute the normal component of the
contact force according to a simple compliant law of the form: <pre>
   fₙ = k(x)₊(1 + dẋ)₊
</pre>
with `(a)₊ = max(0, a)`. The normal contact force `fₙ` is made a continuous
function of the penetration distance x between the bodies (defined to be
positive when the bodies are in contact) and the penetration distance rate ẋ
(with ẋ > 0 meaning the penetration distance is increasing and therefore the
interpenetration between the bodies is also increasing). Stiffness `k` and
dissipation `d` are the combined "effective" stiffness and dissipation for the
pair of contacting geometries. Dissipation is modeled using a Hunt & Crossley
model of dissipation, see @ref mbp_dissipation_model for details.  For
flexibility of parameterization, stiffness and dissipation are set on a
per-geometry basis
(@ref accessing_contact_properties "Accessing point contact parameters"). Given
two geometries with individual stiffness and dissipation parameters (k₁, d₁) and
(k₂, d₂), we define the rule for combined stiffness (k) and dissipation (d) as:
<pre>
  k = (k₁⋅k₂)/(k₁+k₂)
  d = (k₂/(k₁+k₂))⋅d₁ + (k₁/(k₁+k₂))⋅d₂
</pre>
These parameters are optional for each geometry. For any geometry not assigned
these parameters by a user Pre-Finalize, %MultibodyPlant will assign default
values such that the combined parameters of two geometries with default values
match those estimated using the user-supplied "penetration allowance", see
@ref point_contact_defaults.

@note When modeling stiff materials such as steel or ceramics, these model
parameters often need to be tuned as a trade-off between numerical stiffness and
physical accuracy. Stiffer materials lead to a harder to solve system of
equations, affecting the overall performance of the simulation. The convex
approximations provided in Drake are very robust even at high stiffness values,
please refer to @ref Castro2023 "[Castro et al., 2023]" for a study on the
effect of stiffness on solver performance.

@subsubsection point_contact_defaults Default Parameters

@note The treatment of default parameters is undergoing a major revision. Please
refer to the documentation for
@ref drake::geometry::DefaultProximityProperties "DefaultProximityProperties"
and for AddMultibodyPlant(). For now, we still support the "penetration
allowance" workflow outlined below, but that might change.

While we strongly recommend setting these parameters appropriately for your
model,
@ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant "MultibodyPlant" aids the estimation of
these coefficients using a heuristic function based on a user-supplied
"penetration allowance", see
@ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant::set_penetration_allowance() "set_penetration_allowance()".
 This heuristics offers a good starting point when creating a simulation for the
first time. Users can then set material properties for specific geometries once
they observe the results of a first simulation with these defaults. The
penetration allowance is a number in meters that specifies the order of
magnitude of the average penetration between bodies in the system that the user
is willing to accept as reasonable for the problem being solved. For instance,
in the robotic manipulation of ordinary daily objects the user might set this
number to 1 millimeter. However, the user might want to increase it for the
simulation of heavy walking robots for which an allowance of 1 millimeter would
result in a very stiff system.

As for the dissipation coefficient in the simple law above,
@ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant "MultibodyPlant" chooses the dissipation
coefficient d to model inelastic collisions and therefore sets it so that the
penetration distance x behaves as a critically damped oscillator. That is, at
the limit of ideal rigid contact (very high stiffness k or equivalently the
penetration allowance goes to zero), this method behaves as a unilateral
constraint on the penetration distance, which models a perfect inelastic
collision. For most applications, such as manipulation and walking, this is the
desired behavior.

When
@ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant::set_penetration_allowance() "set_penetration_allowance()"
 is called,
@ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant "MultibodyPlant" will estimate reasonable
stiffness and dissipation coefficients as a function of the input penetration
allowance. Users will want to run their simulation a number of times to
determine if they are satisfied with the level of inter-penetration actually
observed in the simulation; if the observed penetration is too large, the user
will want to set a smaller penetration allowance. If the system is too stiff and
the time integration requires very small time steps while at the same time the
user can afford larger inter-penetrations, the user will want to increase the
penetration allowance. Typically, the observed penetration will be proportional
to the penetration allowance. Thus scaling the penetration allowance by say a
factor of 0.5, would typically results in inter-penetrations being reduced by
the same factor of 0.5. In summary, users should choose the largest penetration
allowance that results in inter-penetration levels that are acceptable for the
particular application (even when in theory this penetration should be zero for
perfectly rigid bodies.)

For a given penetration allowance, the contact interaction that takes two bodies
with a non-zero approaching velocity to zero approaching velocity, takes place
in a finite amount of time (for ideal rigid contact this time is zero.) A good
estimate of this time period is given by a call to
@ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant::get_contact_penalty_method_time_scale() "get_contact_penalty_method_time_scale()".
 Users might want to query this value to
either set the maximum time step in error-controlled time integration or to set
the time step for fixed time step integration. As a guidance, typical fixed time
step integrators will become unstable for time steps larger than about a tenth
of this time scale.

@subsection crafting_collision_geometry Choosing the Right Collision Geometry

The compliant point contact model only reports a single contact between bodies.
More particularly, the contact is characterized by a single point. In some cases
(e.g., a steel ball on a table surface), that is perfectly fine. For objects
that contact across a large surface area (such as a box on the table), this
characterization has two negative implications:
 - the contact point will not be guaranteed to be at the center of pressure,
   possibly inducing unrealistic torque, and
 - not be temporally coherent. This will lead to instability artifacts which
   can only be addressed through smaller time steps.

Both of these issues can be addressed by changing the geometry that
represent the body's contact surface. For some shapes (e.g., boxes), we can
introduce two sets of collision elements: discrete "points" at the corners,
and a box capturing the volume (see
<a href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/examples/kuka_iiwa_arm/models/objects/block_for_pick_and_place.urdf">
block_for_pick_and_place.urdf</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/blob/master/examples/multibody/inclined_plane_with_body/inclined_plane_with_body.cc">
inclined_plane_with_body.cc</a> in Drake's examples).
With this strategy, the contact "points" are actually small-radius spheres. The
volume-capturing box should actually be inset from those spheres such that when
the box is lying on a plane (such that the logical contact manifold would be a
face), only the contact points make contact, providing reliable points of
contact. However, for arbitrary configurations contact with the box will provide
more general contact.

The Hydroelastic contact model described below in @ref hydro_contact
"Hydroelastic Contact", was designed to resolve these issues in a principled
manner. We recommend switching to this model unless other requirements such as
simulation speed are a constraint.

@section hydro_contact Hydroelastic Contact

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a quick overview of the
Hydroelastic contact model and its modeling parameters. More details are provided
in Drake's
@ref hydroelastic_user_guide "Hydroelastic Contact User Guide" and references
therein.

Hydroelastic contact was created to address some of the short-comings in point
contact. In fact, one might argue that many of the strategies used to mitigate
the shortcomings of point contact (such as using lots of points) push it closer
and closer to hydroelastic contact.

Hydroelastic Contact was originally introduced by
@ref Elandt2019 "[Elandt et al., 2019]". Modifications and further development
of the model can be found in @ref Masterjohn2022 "[Masterjohn et al., 2022]". In
Drake, we refer to this model as the “hydroelastic” model. It differs from point
contact in how it characterizes the contact. Rather than a single point, it
imagines an entire contact surface. This surface is an approximation of the
contact surface as visualized in Figure 2(b).

When two objects come into contact, forces are produced due to deformation
("strain") of the objects at the contact interface. At first touch, there are no
forces but as the objects are pressed further they deform to produce a region
over which contact pressure is non-zero, causing equal-and-opposite forces to
act on the objects. Calculating the actual deformations is expensive.
Hydroelastic contact is based on the idea that for relatively small deformations
we can approximate the resulting contact interface and pressure distribution
without having to compute the actual deformations. We do that by precalculating
a "pressure field" on the interior of compliant objects (see Figure 3). The
pressure field approximates the pressure that would result from deforming the
surface to some point within the field. A point on the surface (that is, no
deformation) experiences zero pressure, but as it is pressed inward, it
experiences an increase in pressure (up to a maximum pressure on the interior of
the body). When two bodies are colliding, we look for a surface in the
intersecting volume where the pressure on the surface is the same in each
object; it’s an equilibrium surface (see Figure 4). There is pressure defined
across the entire contact surface. It is integrated to define the resultant
contact force and moment.

@image html "multibody/hydroelastics/images/contact-fig-03.png"

Figure 3: Three shapes and possible pressure fields in the interior of the
object. Pressure is zero at the outer boundary, and maximum on the interior.

@image html "multibody/hydroelastics/images/contact-fig-04.png"

Figure 4: The equilibrium contact surface (pale green) between two bodies where
the left-hand, yellow body has (a) less compliance, (b) equal compliance, and
(c) greater compliance.

This equilibrium surface has important properties:
- The contact surface will always be contained within the intersecting volume.
- The surface’s edge will always lie on the surface of both objects and have
  zero pressure.
- The location of the surface depends on the relative compliance of the two
  objects. As one object becomes more rigid than the other, the contact surface
  begins to converge to its surface (see Figure 4). As one surface becomes
  perfectly rigid, the other object deforms completely to conform to its shape.
- The contacting bodies need not be convex, nor will the contact surface
  between two objects necessarily be a single contiguous patch. For non-convex
  geometries, the contact can be meaningfully represented by multiple disjoint
  patches. The resultant contact force will still be meaningful.
- The resultant contact force is continuous with respect to the relative pose
  between bodies. In fact, the contact surface’s mesh, its area, and the
  pressures measured on the surface are likewise continuous.

@subsection hydro_model_parameters Model Parameters

The hydroelastic modulus has units of pressure, i.e. `Pa (N/m²)`. The
hydroelastic modulus is often estimated based on the Young's modulus of the
material though in the hydroelastic model it represents an effective elastic
property. For instance, @ref Elandt2019 "[Elandt et al., 2019]" chooses to use
`E = G`, with `G` the P-wave elastic modulus `G = (1-ν)/(1+ν)/(1-2ν)E`, with ν
the Poisson ratio, consistent with the theory of layered solids in which plane
sections remain planar after compression. Another possibility is to specify `E =
E*`, with `E*` the effective elastic modulus given by the Hertz theory of
contact, `E* = E/(1-ν²)`. In all of these cases a sound estimation of
`hydroelastic_modulus` starts with the Young's modulus of the material. However,
due to numerical conditioning, much smaller values are used in practice for hard
materials such as steel. While Young's modulus of steel is about 200 GPa (2×10¹¹
Pa), hydroelastic modulus values of about 10⁵−10⁷ Pa lead to good approximations
of rigid contact, with no practical reason to use higher values.

@note Although the hydroelastic modulus carries the same units as the more
familiar elastic moduli mentioned above, it is qualitatively different. Do not
expect to use values for those moduli for the hydroelastic modulus to good
effect.

As with point contact, the hydroelastic contact model uses a Hunt & Crossley
dissipation model (see @ref mbp_dissipation_model). It differs in defining the
combined effective dissipation parameter; for hydroelastic contact, the
combined dissipation depends on the hydroelastic moduli of the contacting
geometries. For two hydroelastic bodies A and B, with hydroelastic moduli `Eᵃ`
and `Eᵇ`, respectively, and dissipation `dᵃ` and `dᵇ`, respectively, the
effective dissipation is defined according to the combination law: <pre>
  E = Eᵃ⋅Eᵇ/(Eᵃ + Eᵇ),
  d = E/Eᵃ⋅dᵃ + E/Eᵇ⋅dᵇ = Eᵇ/(Eᵃ+Eᵇ)⋅dᵃ + Eᵃ/(Eᵃ+Eᵇ)⋅dᵇ
</pre>
thus dissipation is weighted in accordance with the fact that the softer
material will deform more and faster and thus the softer material dissipation is
given more importance.

The @ref hug_geometry_properties "hydroelastic user guide" shows how values for
these properties can be assigned to geometries.

@subsection hydro_practice Hydroelastic Contact in practice

The theory operates on arbitrary geometries and pressure fields. In practice,
we operate on discrete representations of both the geometry and the field.

Compliant objects are represented by tetrahedral meshes. The Drake data
type is @ref drake::geometry::VolumeMesh "VolumeMesh". The pressure fields on
those meshes are piecewise linear.

The resulting contact surface is likewise a discrete mesh. This mesh may be
built of nothing but triangles or polygons. The choice of representation has
various implications on the computation of contact forces (see below). The
pressure on the contact surface is likewise a piecewise linear function.

Objects with very large hydroelastic modulus can introduce stiffness into the
numerics of the contact resolution computation and lead to ill conditioning,
affecting simulation performance and robustness. For these cases, Drake permits
declaring an object as "rigid hydroelastic" (see @ref creating_hydro_reps.) When
a *rigid* hydroelastic object interacts with
other *compliant* hydroelastic objects, the contact surface always follows the
surface of the rigid object. Think of it as the compliant object doing 100% of
the deformation, so it conforms to the shape of the rigid object. However,
rigid hydroelastic objects have limitations. There is no hydroelastic contact
surface between two rigid hydroelastic representations -- when contact is
observed between two such objects, the contact will be characterized with
point contact (or maybe even throw), depending on how the
@ref hug_enabling "contact model" has been configured. For
this reason, the use of the rigid hydroelastic declaration should be used
judiciously -- making everything compliant can be simpler in reasoning about the
scene.

Important points to note:
- The time cost of resolving contact scales with the complexity of the contact
  surface (number of faces).
- The complexity of the contact surface is a function of the complexity of the
  contacting geometries.
- The best performance comes from the lowest resolution meshes that produce
  “acceptable” behaviors.
- It is not universally true that every geometry is represented discretely. The
  implementation may represent some shapes differently when it allows
  performance improvements. The canonical example would be a half space
  geometry. As a shape with infinite volume, it would be infeasible to create a
  finite, discrete representation. It is also unnecessary. Intersecting meshes
  directly with a half space is far more efficient.

@section mbp_dissipation_model Modeling Dissipation

We use a dissipation model inspired by the model in
@ref HuntCrossley1975 "[Hunt and Crossley 1975]", parameterized by a dissipation
constant with units of inverse of velocity, i.e. `s/m`.

To be more precise, compliant point contact forces are modeled as a function of
state x: <pre>
  f(x) = fₑ(x)⋅(1 - d⋅vₙ(x))₊
</pre>
where here `fₑ(x)` denotes the elastic forces, vₙ(x) is the contact velocity in
the normal direction (negative when objects approach) and `(a)₊` denotes "the
positive part of a". The model parameter `d ` is the Hunt & Crossley dissipation
constant, in s/m. The Hunt & Crossley term `(1 - d⋅vₙ(x))₊` models the effect of
dissipation due to deformation.

Similarly, Drake's hydroelastic contact model incorporates dissipation at the
stress level, rather than forces. That is, pressure `p(x)` at a specific point
on the contact surface replaces the force `f(x)` in the point contact model:
<pre>
  p(x) = pₑ(x)⋅(1 - d⋅vₙ(x))₊
</pre>
where `pₑ(x)` is the (elastic) hydroelastic pressure and once more the term
`(1 - d⋅vₙ(x))₊` models Hunt & Crossley dissipation.

This is our preferred model of dissipation for several reasons:
1. It is based on physics and has been developed based on experimental
   observations.
2. It is a continuous function of state, as in the real physical world.
   Moreover, this continuity leads to better conditioned systems of
   equations.
3. The bounce velocity after an impact is bounded by 1/d, giving a quick
   physical intuition when setting this parameter.
4. Typical values are in the range [0; 100] s/m, with a value of 20 s/m being
   typical.
5. Values larger than 500 s/m are unphysical and usually lead to numerical
   problems when using discrete approximations given how time is
   discretized.

The Hunt & Crossley model is supported by the
drake::multibody::DiscreteContactApproximation::kTamsi,
drake::multibody::DiscreteContactApproximation::kSimilar, and
drake::multibody::DiscreteContactApproximation::kLagged model approximations. In
particular, drake::multibody::DiscreteContactApproximation::kSimilar and
drake::multibody::DiscreteContactApproximation::kLagged are convex
approximations of contact, using a solver with theoretical and practical
convergence guarantees.

 </pre>
 where μₛ is the "static" coefficient of friction and fₜ and fₙ are the
 tangential (friction) and normal components of the contact force, respectively.

 For @ref hydro_contact "hydroelastic contact" the same law can be stated in

 where Tₜ and pₙ are the tangential (friction) and normal stresses,

 The friction force fₜ (or stress Tₜ) is perpendicular to the contact normal.
 It's direction within a plane perpendicular to the contact normal, is
 determined by MDP. The MDP states that the direction of the friction force is
 such that it maximizes the amount of dissipation due to friction. Therefore,
 for a sliding contact with a non-zero slip velocity vector vₜ, the friction
 force directly opposes vₜ and its magnitude is μₖfₙ (or μₖpₙ), where μₖ is the
 "dynamic" (or kinetic) coefficient of friction, with μₖ ≤ μₛ. This can be
 written as:
 <pre> 
  fₜ = -μₖ vₜ/‖vₜ‖ fₙ.

 @section friction_numerical_approximations Numerical Approximations

 Drake can model multibody systems as being @ref mbp_continuous "continuous" or
 @ref mbp_discrete "discrete". Each of these represent different numerical
 approximations of the same underlying physics.

 In a nutshell, @ref mbp_continuous "continuous" models formulate the multibody
 physics at the acceleration level and use a @ref stribeck_approximation
 "regularized model of Coulomb friction". This model is a continuous function of
 state that can be integrated in time using standard error-controlled numerical
 methods.

 @ref mbp_discrete "Discrete" models on the other hand, formulate the multibody
 physics at the velocity level, and incorporate friction as constraints. Now,
 these constraints can be regularized similarly to continuous models, to improve
 numerics and robustness. Drake's discrete non-convex model with regularized
 friction is presented in @ref Castro2019 "[Castro et al., 2019]", and novel
 convex approximations are presented @ref Castro2022 "[Castro et al., 2022]" and
 @ref Castro2023 "[Castro et al., 2023]".

 Please refer to @ref multibody_solvers for further details.

 @note Discrete models, formulated at the velocity level, cannot differentiate
 between static (μₛ) and dynamic (μₖ) friction; only dynamic friction can be
 resolved. Therefore the static coefficient of friction is ignored.

/** @addtogroup hydro_margin Margin for Hydroelastic Contact

In Drake, multibody systems with frictional contact are simulated via a discrete
approximation, see @ref mbp_discrete "Discrete Models for Simulation" (while
Drake also offers @ref mbp_continuous "Continuous Models for Simulation",
currently the discrete approximation performs best.) The accuracy of these
discrete approximations depends on the selected time step size `h`. Moreover, at
large enough time steps, instability problems can arise leading to unphysical
intermittent contact.

To mitigate these instability problems, we introduce the concept of "margin".
While margin is not a new concept (@ref Catto2013 "[Catto, 2013]"), the way
margin is used in Drake differs from its traditional purpose in game engines.
Game engines such as Bullet (@ref BulletSdkManual "[Coumans, 2015; §4]") and
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.2/Documentation/Manual/speculative-ccd.html">Unity</a>
introduce margin mostly as a mechanism to mitigate pass through problems that
can arise when objects move at high speeds and/or the simulation time step sizes
are large in order to meet real-time requirements within a limited computational
budget. In Drake however, margin is used to mitigate instability problems
inherent to discrete schemes with a fixed time step size.

@note As mentioned, the concepts of margin and speculative constraints discussed
below are not new. What is new and unique to Drake, is the extension of these
ideas to @ref hydro_contact "Hydroelastic Contact".

@note Margin in Drake is a concept that only applies to @ref hydro_contact "Hydroelastic Contact".

In the following sections we describe why we introduce margin, how we do it, and
its limitations.

@section discrete_contact_instabilities Discrete Contact Instabilities

We motivate the concept of margin by considering an instability problem with the
simulation in Fig. 1. Two boxes (of 0.2 m x 0.15 m x 0.08 m and mass of 0.2 kg)
are stacked on top of each other. Their dynamics is simulated at a relatively
large time step of 10 ms (large for robotics applications). Only their surface
meshes are shown as wire frames so that we can appreciate the contact surface,
colored by pressure. While we'd expect the upper box to rest stably on the lower
box, we observe a wobbling instability where the contact surface shifts back and
forth between two corners.

@image html drake/multibody/plant/images/unstable_box_box_contact.gif "Figure 1: Unstable flat-on-flat contact." width=50%

This wobbling is not physical, but rather a numerical instability. To gain
insight into this problem, we analyze the simplified system in Fig. 2. In this
case, contact takes place between a single box and a ground plane in 2D.
In Fig. 2, we see the box at three consecutive time steps, labeled tₙ, tₙ₊₁,
and, tₙ₊₂. In this simplified system, we've also simplified the contact model to
a point contact model in which only the corners marked in red can make
contact with the ground. At time tₙ only the left corner is in penetration. For
such a configuration the contact resolution phase will predict a contact force
that will attempt to minimize this interpenetration. If the time step size is
large enough, the box's configuration can actually overshoot into the state
sketched for tₙ₊₁. Now the box is in a new state where the right corner is in
contact and the left corner is out of contact. In this configuration, the box
can overshoot once again to the state at tₙ₊₂. Even more, the motion of the box
can fall into a limit cycle with oscillating contact between the two corners.

The situation is more complex in Fig. 1, but the same underlying principle
applies.

@image html drake/multibody/plant/images/discrete_instabilities.png "Figure 2: Oscillating contact results in wobbling instabilities." width=35%

The instability arises when the stable contact between two object has a large
cross-sectional area on a plane (i.e., it really doesn't happen between spheres
and planes). Figure 3 shows an example of this instability for the contact
between a mug placed on top of a plate. When the visuals for the geometries are
turned off, we can see the two contact surfaces (table/plate and plate/table)
rocking back and forth. The visualization also includes the contact forces (red)
and moments (blue). In both contacts, the table contact surface is a large, flat
circular patch. Even if the mug had an extruded rim on its bottom, the stable
contact would be a large, planar ring-like patch, exhibiting the same behavior.

@section speculative_constraints Speculative Contact Constraints

Lets consider once again the schematic in Fig. 2. At each time step, the solver
only adds one constraint for each reported contact point (left or right).
Satisfying this single constraint can lead to unbounded "correction". If,
instead, the set of contact constraints is augmented to include both points --
a point in contact and a point nearly in contact -- the solver can now use this
additional information to compute a force that can avoid the overshooting that
leads to the instability.  We are essentially adding contact constraints before
contact actually happens. Whether these constraints become active or not, will
ultimately depend on the contact resolution phase, which considers balance of
momentum and the physics of contact. We refer to this new set of constraints as
"speculative contact constraints", @ref Catto2013 "[Catto, 2013]". Speculative
constraints are highlighted with blue boxes in Fig. 2.

To provide more context, we'll discuss briefly how the solver can use
information from speculative constraints. Each contact pair will be associated
with a signed distance ϕ (defined negative if objects overlap). For a compliant
point contact (we discuss hydroelastic contact below) with stiffness k (we can
ignore dissipation for this discussion), the normal force is modeled according
to `fₙ = k (-ϕ)₊`, where (a)₊ = max(0, a). Notice that fₙ ≥ 0 (i.e. repulsive)
always. At each time step Drake's geometry engine is invoked to compute all
contact pairs at the (current) time step before contact resolution takes place
(where a solver uses physics to determine the next state). Without margin, the
geometry engine only reports contact pairs of geometry in penetration, with
signed distances ϕ₀ < 0 (penetration) at the current time step, before contact
resolution. To estimate the signed distance function ϕ (from ϕ₀) at the next
state, Drake's solvers use a first order approximation as ϕ ≈ ϕ₀ + h⋅vₙ, where
ϕ₀ is the signed distance at the current time step, vₙ the normal component of
the (next time step) relative velocity between the two participating bodies at
the contact point and h is the time step size. Using this approximation for each
of the contact pairs reported by the geometry engine, Drake solvers set
constraints to model the contact force as
<pre>
  fₙ ≈ k (-ϕ₀ - h⋅vₙ)₊,  ϕ₀ < 0,                                           (1)
</pre>
where condition ϕ₀ < 0 is actually implicit by the fact that the geometry engine
only reports pairs in penetration, with ϕ₀ < 0. System velocities, along with
normal velocities `vₙ` in (1) are unknown. These are determined during the
contact resolution phase along with the contact forces that satisfy the
equations of motion.

To include speculative constraints, we need to allow the geometry engine to
report pairs with ϕ₀ > 0 (i.e. before contact happens, as in the blue boxes in
Fig. 2). To be thorough, we'd include all geometry pairs that might possibly
make contact in the next time step, no matter how long distances ϕ₀ at the
current step might be. However, there are good reasons to limit the set of
speculative constraints:
  1. Given distance ϕ₀ and relative velocity, most pairs will not make contact
     within the next time step.
  2. The linear approximation ϕ ≈ ϕ₀ + h⋅vₙ starts losing accuracy the farther
     points are.

Therefore speculative constraints between distant points are generally useless.
Moreover, we'd be paying a higher O(n²) computational cost to compute and track
this useless information.

Therefore, in practice we ask for a subset that only contains geometry pairs
within a _margin_ distance δ. That is, we set constraints to model forces as:
<pre>
  fₙ ≈ k (-ϕ₀ - h⋅vₙ)₊,  ϕ₀ < δ,                                           (2)
</pre>

In the limit to δ = ∞, we'd include all pairs possibly in contact, though at a
significant increase of the computational cost due to geometry. With δ = 0, no
speculative constraints are considered.

Speculative contact constraints come from finding more "contact" points. When
margin is zero, only those points actually in contact are reported. As margin
grows, we also need to find points that are outside of contact, but within
margin distance of contact. There is an increased computational cost for
positive margin values in both finding those additional points as well as
handling the constraints that arise from them. Tuned well, the impact of this
additional computation can be negligible compared to the benefits of increased
stability.

The precise value of margin is therefore determined as a trade-off between
accuracy/stability and performance. Section @ref margin_how_much discusses how
we determine values of margin in detail.

@note Margin does not introduce action-at-a-distance effects. The speculative
contact constraints only come into play (producing non-zero forces) if the
solver finds they would make contact within the discrete time step being solved
and the force associated with that point is requisite to the nature of
anticipated contact.

@section margin_for_hydroelastics Hydroelastic Contact

Speculative contact constraints within a given margin fit well within a
framework in terms of distance constraints — contact pairs with a distance
within the margin threshold are included in the contact resolution phase. In
contrast, how to introduce margin within the hydroelastic contact framework is
not as straightforward.

In the @ref hydro_contact "hydroelastic contact model", each geometry is
assigned a body-centric _pressure field_. The contact surface between two
overlapping geometries is computed as the surface of equal hydroelastic
pressure. Historically, the pressure field is defined to be zero at the surface
of the geometry (no contact implies no contact pressure). Contact surfaces
always have non-negative pressure and lay completely within the intersecting
volume of the two colliding geometries.

To include the concept of margin, we need to extend the notion of hydroelastic
contact to include _imminent_ contact. A contact surface shouldn't be limited
to the non-negative region of the pressure field but should extend into the
negative region at a distance equal to the margin amount. By doing so, we can
extract the necessary point data for introducing speculative constraints.

Extending the contact surface into the negative region can be done a number of
ways. We chose an approach that limits the impact on computation. The goal is
to increase the extent of the pressure field over which we can find contact
surfaces, without increasing the cost of finding the surfaces. To that end, we
replace the specified compliant hydroelastic geometry with an alternative
representation whose surface is an approximation of the offset surface of the
original geometry's surface (extended outward by margin distance). The
pressure field defined within this "inflated" geometry is defined such that the
zero level set of the pressure field is a good approximation of the original
geometry's surface (where reasonably possible, it is an exact reproduction).

It's worth noting that only in a few cases are we truly producing an offset
surface (spheres and capsules). For other convex primitives we approximate the
offset surface of a shape with a larger shape of the same type. Non-convex
shapes require additional consideration and are discussed in further detail in
@ref margin_non_convex.

Figure 4 exemplifies this process for the case of a cylinder. Iso-surfaces of
constant pressure, colored by pressure, are shown. The extended pressure is
defined such that the zero pressure level set corresponds to the original
cylinder.

@image html drake/multibody/plant/images/extended_cylinder.png "Figure 4: Inflated cylinder and its pressure field." width=35%

The newly inflated geometries and their extended pressure fields are then
processed as any other hydroelastic fields. When the geometries (including their
margin region) overlap, the contact surface is computed as the surface of equal
pressure. This computation will now lead to tessellated contact surfaces with a
thin "skirt", of thickness in the order of the margin, all around the contact
surface where pressures are negative. Figure 5 shows peppers in contact with a
blue table surface. The peppers have been modeled with a very large margin value
of 1 cm to emphasize this "skirt" of negative pressure values. Normally, the
contact surface would, by definition, lie completely within the pepper. Here,
we can see the contact surface extending outside the pepper by about the margin
distance, showing the negative pressure regime.

@image html drake/multibody/plant/images/peppers_margin_1cm.png "Figure 5: Pepper models with a very large margin of δ = 1 cm." width=30%

Similarly to the compliant point contact model in terms of signed distance, we
use a first order approximation of the pressure field as p ≈ (p₀ + h⋅vₙ⋅g)₊,
where p₀ is the previous time step pressure and g = ∂p/∂n is the gradient of the
pressure field in the normal direction
(see @ref Masterjohn2022 "[Masterjohn et al., 2022]"). With this, the normal
force contribution from a polygon of area Δ is:
<pre>
  fₙ = Δ⋅(p₀ + h⋅vₙ⋅g)₊,
</pre>
where for speculative constraints p₀ < 0.

Therefore, polygons with a negative pressure are processed by the contact
solver as speculative constraints, and will only generate forces if the new
configuration pushes these polygons into the positive pressure region. Polygons
that after the resolution phase still have a negative pressure will not produce
forces. As with the example of Fig. 5, the margin layer effectively increases
the number of constraints, increasing the contact problem size.

For more on hydroelastic contact, including the modeling of dissipation, refer
to @ref hydro_contact "Hydroelastic Contact".

@section margin_how_much But How Much Margin?

How much margin is enough to mitigate stability problems and how does this
quantity scale or depend on problem parameters such stiffness, size, etc.?

To answer this question we consider the simplified two-dimensional system in
Fig. 6. This is a massless rod of length `L` connecting two points of mass
`m/2`. We assume the rod to be in a limit cycle between two states, State I
(shown on the left) and State II (shown on the right). Only one point is in
penetration in each state. In the discrete setting, the rod is assumed to go
back and forth between these two states in a single time step. The states are
assumed symmetric, with the rod rotated an angle θ in State I and an angle -θ in
State II. Due to this symmetry, the angular velocity to go from State II to
State I is ω and the angular velocity to go from State I to State II is -ω. This
analysis omits dissipation, but we believe the conclusions are still applicable
in the presence of dissipation.

@image html drake/multibody/plant/images/margin_stability.png "Figure 6: Simplified system for stability analysis." width=50%

Since the system is in this symmetric limit cycle, the rod does not move in the
vertical direction. Therefore the mean normal force due to contact must balance
gravity, i.e. `<fₙ> = m⋅g`. Since only one point is in contact at each state, we
have that `<fₙ> = fₙ`, where we denoted with fₙ the instantaneous normal force
at one of these points. Thus fₙ = m⋅g. Notice this force value is independent of
stiffness.

The rotational inertia of this system is `I = m⋅L²/4`. In the discrete system,
the system moves between State I and State II according to the balance of
momentum:
<pre>
  I⋅(ω − ω₀)=h⋅fₙ⋅L/2,
  θ = θ₀ + h⋅ω,
</pre>
with θ₀ and ω₀ the previous angle and angular velocity, respectively. Since the
states are symmetric, ω₀ = -ω and θ₀ = -θ. Using the expressions for `I` and
`fₙ` we can determine the angular velocity to be `ω = h⋅g/2`. The angle is then
θ = h²⋅g/(2L). The total angle change is Δθ = 2⋅θ = h²⋅g/L. We can now
determine the amplitude of these oscillations in signed distance as Δϕ =
L⋅sin(Δθ) ≈ L⋅Δθ. Putting it all together we obtain:
<pre>
  Δϕ = h²⋅g.                                                               (3)
</pre>

This result reveals a number of important properties for the amplitude of these
oscillations:
 1. independent of mass m and of size L,
 2. independent of contact stiffness k,
 3. scale with h²,

This is a very important result, because if it holds for more complex and
arbitrary geometries, it tells us that we can use a single value of the margin δ
for all of our simulations (for as long as we are on the same planet).

@note The independence of (3) on stiffness is predicated on the assumption that
only one of the points is in contact at a given time. As stiffness is decreased,
the oscillating rod would essentially _sink_ into the ground. As this happens,
both contact points could come into contact at the same time. Eventually,
oscillations would no longer persist due to this effect. We observed this to be
generally true in more complex systems involving more complex geometries;
compliance helps to mitigate these oscillations as more points come into
contact, though it may require unphysically low values of compliance.

@subsection margin_its_effect The Effect of Margin

In the analysis of the simple rod system in Fig. 6, we realize that these
oscillations can be mitigated completely if at each time step we consider both
the left and right contact points when solving the contact problem at each time
step. Moreover, the analysis tells us that for more complex systems, it is not
really necessary to consider all O(n²) geometry pairs in the scene, but really
only those that are within a distance in the order of the estimated amplitude of
the vibrations, i.e. O(h²⋅g).

With this in mind, we then expect that if δ = O(h²⋅g), then these spurious
oscillations will be mitigated. We verify this idea in the original system of
Fig. 1, with a wide range of margin values. To test a very adversarial situation
we use E = 10⁹ Pa (as explained above, compliance helps mitigate these
instabilities). For each contact constraint we measure the signed distance ϕ and
compute its standard deviation σ(|ϕ|) as a metric to characterize the amplitude
of these spurious oscillations. Since h² changes several orders of magnitude,
and guided by (3), we plot in Fig. 7 the dimensionless amplitude σ(|ϕ|) /
(h²⋅g). 

@note Theoretically, for the rod, the dimensionless amplitude σ(|ϕ|) / (h²⋅g)
should equal one. For more complex geometries, we do not expect this to be true.
However we do expect this quantity to be of _order_ one. This explains why we do
not even need a logarithmic scale in Fig. 7 while being a nice confirmation of
(3).

Finally, notice we use `δ / (h²⋅g)` for the horizontal axis. This is again
guided by (3), which predicts that values of margin δ effective at mitigating
oscillations are order h². We observe in Fig. 7 that indeed for `δ / (h²⋅g) ≳ 1`
the instabilities die off.

@image html drake/multibody/plant/images/instability_vs_margin.png "Figure 7: Standard deviation of the vibrations vs. margin." width=30%

Once again, keep in mind that the rod analysis is very simplified. For instance,
notice in Fig. 7 that at larger time steps margin δ is more effective yet
(requiring only `δ / (h²⋅g) ≳ 0.01` for oscillations to die off). This can be
explained by the _numerical dissipation_ introduced by discrete schemes, which
is not taken into account in our simplified analysis, and goes away as time step
is decreased.

Figure 7 indicates that for time steps [10⁻², 10⁻³, 2×10⁻⁴] (seconds) that the
oscillation disappeared with δ / (h²⋅g) ≈ [10⁻², 10⁻¹, 10⁻¹], respectively.
Given those values, we can solve for margin values of δ = [10⁻⁵, 10⁻⁶, 4×10⁻⁸]
(meters), respectively. The worst case comes from the largest margin, 10⁻⁵ m
(most expensive computation). To account for factors not included in our
analysis, we in general choose the very conservative value of `δ = 10⁻⁴ m`. We
confirmed the effectiveness of this value over and over again with additional
experimentation on more complex systems as those in Figs. 3 and 5. While
incredibly effective, notice how small this value is.

@section margin_contact_results Contact Results

TODO: write.

@section margin_appendices Appendix

The following sections cover more advanced material not really essential for the
general understanding and effective use of margin and speculative contact
constraints in Drake. We provide this material for completeness since many
advanced users might find it useful.

TODO: Write this.

@subsection margin_scaling_confirmation Numerical Confirmation of the Scaling Law

The result in (3) predicts the magnitude of contact oscillations in the absence
of margin (δ = 0) for the simplified system of Fig. 6. The estimation predicts
`Δϕ = h²⋅g`. This estimate will not hold exactly for arbitrary geometries and
mass distributions. The expectation, however, is that the scaling `Δϕ ~ h²⋅g`
still does provide a good estimate of the magnitude of these spurious
oscillations.

The aim of this section is to verify to what extent this scaling does provide a
good estimate of the amplitude of these oscillations in a more complex case. We
are particularly interested not only to understand to what extent the scaling
law applies to this system but even more so, to verify the independence of these
results with parameters such as stiffness and mass (the simplified case was
actually shown to be independent of these parameters). If (3) happens to provide
a good estimate, then we have a very good chance of success at choosing a value
of margin δ for arbitrary simulation cases.

For a general contact problem, many physical and numerical parameters are
involved:
  1. Hydroelastic modulus E.
  2. Mass (or density).
  3. Sizes and aspect ratios.
  4. Shape and mass distribution
  5. Time step.
  6. Hunt & Crossley dissipation.

To start somewhere, we fix the shapes we use, and choose as our first study case
the stack of boxes we started with, Fig. 1. To verify (3), we'd need to scan
this high dimensional space of parameters, a daunting task. To make this
tractable we resource the incredibly powerful tool of dimensional analysis. This
method reduces the dimension of the parameter space by finding an alternative
(smaller) set of dimensionless parameters. The underlying method is described by
Buckingham π theorem, though in practice selecting these parameters often
requires a great deal of experience and physical intuition. We won't go into
detail here, but let's consider a common example in fluid dynamics. While the
drag force a fluid exerts on an object is an incredibly complex function of
density, viscosity, flow speed, geometry and size, engineers make very useful
plots involving two (now very popular) dimensionless quantities: drag
coefficient vs. Reynolds number. We therefore use the same procedure to find two
dimensionless parameters that can succinctly capture the physics (and numerics
in this case) of the problem at hand.

We start by defining an _effective spring stiffness_ as `k = E⋅A/H`, with E the
hydroelastic modulus, A the area of contact (in our case the area of the base of
the box), and H the _Elastic Foundation_ depth (in our case half of the boxes
minimum side length). With this, we can define the (angular) frequency `ω =
(k/m)¹ᐟ²`, similar to a spring-mass system, where `m` is the mass of the box.
This frequency characterizes the dynamics of the compliant contact, and our
intuition tells us it should be an important quantity in the analysis. With
this, we define our first dimensionless parameter: `π₁ = h⋅ω = h⋅(k/m)¹ᐟ²`.

Our second parameter must involve the amplitude of the oscillations. Guided by
our estimation in (3), we define `π₂ = σ(|ϕ|) / (h²⋅g)`, where to characterize
the amplitude of the oscillations we measure the standard deviation `σ(|ϕ|)` of
the penetrations.

Having identified these two dimensionless parameters, we now run a large number
of simulations, sampling the parameter space (E, m, sizes, h). We then measure
`σ(|ϕ|)` for each, compute π₁ and π₂ and plot them with the hope to find a clear
relationship among them.

The parameters we sweep are:
 1. Hydroelastic modulus E, from 10⁴ Pa to 10⁹ Pa.
 2. Time step, h ∈ [6.25×10⁻⁴, 1.25×10⁻³, 2.5×10⁻³, 5×10⁻³, 10⁻²], in seconds.
 3. Size. We scale the size by factors of 2 and 4.
 4. Shape. We scale only along the x-axis of the box.
 5. Mass. Density is kept constant, changing accordingly as the size of the box
    changes.

All simulations use a non-zero Hunt & Crossley dissipation `d = 20 s/m` to keep
the rattling instability somewhat under control to avoid the upper box from
drifting and falling to the side.

We plot `σ(|ϕ|) / (h²⋅g)` in Fig. 8. Labels correspond to hydroelastic modulus
`E`, and in parentheses to size and shape changes. The very first thing we
observe clearly is that oscillations die off below a frequency close to the
Nyquist frequency (= 1/(2h), or h⋅(k/m)¹ᐟ² = π). This makes sense, as the
dynamics of contact is resolved by the simulation time step, the numerical
method is able to recover from this spurious oscillatory behavior. We note that
the increase we observe at the smaller values of `π₁ = h⋅ω` is only an artifact
of the simulations  not reaching yet a steady state; compliance is so low that
with the dissipation used boxes are still settling.

Second, we observe that oscillations develop at frequencies higher than the
Nyquist frequency; time step is not small enough to resolve the dynamics of the
compliant contact. While (3) predicts a constant value in this regime, we
observe for this case (dimensionless) amplitudes in the range π₂ ∈ (0.1, 0.6).
This might seem like a large discrepancy with the simplified analysis, but it's
quite the opposite! Keep in mind this is a significantly more complex system
than the one in Fig. 6 and that parameters change order of magnitude over a wide
range. Even for this case, estimating the amplitude of these vibrations with
~h²⋅g, provides a good approximation.
