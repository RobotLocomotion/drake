///
/// A MultiBodyPlant may contain multiple model instances. Each model instance
/// corresponds to a
/// set of bodies and their connections (joints). Model instances provide
/// methods to get or set the state of the set of bodies (e.g., through
/// GetPositionsAndVelocities() and SetPositionsAndVelocities()), connecting
/// controllers (through get_state_output_port()
/// and get_actuation_input_port()), and organizing duplicate models (read
/// through a parser). In fact, many %MultibodyPlant methods are overloaded
/// to allow operating on the entire plant or just the subset corresponding to
/// the model instance; for example, one GetPositions() method obtains the
/// generalized positions for the entire plant while another GetPositions()
/// method obtains the generalized positions for model instance.
///
/// Model instances are frequently defined through SDF files
/// (using the `model` tag) and are automatically created when SDF
/// files are parsed (by Parser). There are two special
/// multibody::ModelInstanceIndex values. The world body is always
/// multibody::ModelInstanceIndex 0. multibody::ModelInstanceIndex 1 is
/// reserved for all elements with no explicit model instance and
/// is generally only relevant for elements
/// created programmatically (and only when a model instance is not explicitly
/// specified). Note that Parser creates model instances (resulting in a
/// multibody::ModelInstanceIndex ≥ 2) as needed.
///
/// See num_model_instances(),

///
/// <!-- TODO(amcastro-tri): Update this documentation to include:
///      - Bilateral constraints.
///      - Unilateral constraints and contact. -->
///
/// The state of a multibody system `x = [q; v]` is given by its generalized
/// positions vector q, of size `nq` (see num_positions()), and by its
/// generalized velocities vector v, of size `nv` (see num_velocities()).
/// As a Drake @ref systems::System "System", %MultibodyPlant implements the
/// governing equations for a
/// multibody dynamical system in the form `ẋ = f(t, x, u)` with t being
/// time and u the actuation forces. The governing equations for
/// the dynamics of a multibody system modeled with %MultibodyPlant are
/// [Featherstone 2008, Jain 2010]: <pre>
///          q̇ = N(q)v
///   (1)    M(q)v̇ + C(q, v)v = τ
/// </pre>
/// where `M(q)` is the mass matrix of the multibody system, `C(q, v)v`
/// contains Coriolis, centripetal, and gyroscopic terms and
/// `N(q)` is the kinematic coupling matrix describing the relationship between
/// q̇ (the time derivatives of the generalized positions) and the generalized
/// velocities v, [Seth 2010]. `N(q)` is an `nq x nv` matrix.
/// The vector `τ ∈ ℝⁿᵛ` on the right hand side of Eq. (1) is
/// the system's generalized forces. These incorporate gravity, springs,
/// externally applied body forces, constraint forces, and contact forces.
///
/// @anchor sdf_loading
///                  ### Loading models from SDF files
///
/// Drake has the capability to load multibody models from SDF and URDF
/// files.  Consider the example below which loads an acrobot model:
/// @code
///   MultibodyPlant<T> acrobot;
///   SceneGraph<T> scene_graph;
///   Parser parser(&acrobot, &scene_graph);
///   const std::string relative_name =
///     "drake/multibody/benchmarks/acrobot/acrobot.sdf";
///   const std::string full_name = FindResourceOrThrow(relative_name);
///   parser.AddModelFromFile(full_name);
/// @endcode
/// As in the example above, for models including visual geometry, collision
/// geometry or both, the user must specify a SceneGraph for geometry handling.
/// You can find a full example of the LQR controlled acrobot in
/// examples/multibody/acrobot/run_lqr.cc.
///
/// AddModelFromFile() can be invoked multiple times on the same plant in order
/// to load multiple model instances.  Other methods are available on Parser
/// such as AddAllModelsFromFile() which allows creating model instances per
/// each `<model>` tag found in the file. Please refer to each of these
/// methods' documentation for further details.

///   #### Adding a %MultibodyPlant connected to a %SceneGraph to your %Diagram
///
/// Probably the simplest way to add and wire up a MultibodyPlant with

///
/// Recommended usages:
///
/// Assign to a MultibodyPlant reference (ignoring the SceneGraph):
/// @code
///   MultibodyPlant<double>& plant =
///       AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(&builder, 0.0 /* time_step */);
///   plant.DoFoo(...);
/// @endcode
/// This flavor is the simplest, when the SceneGraph is not explicitly needed.
/// (It can always be retrieved later via GetSubsystemByName("scene_graph").)
///
/// Assign to auto, and use the named public fields:
/// @code
///   auto items = AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(&builder, 0.0 /* time_step */);
///   items.plant.DoFoo(...);
///   items.scene_graph.DoBar(...);
/// @endcode
/// or taking advantage of C++17's structured binding
/// @code
///   auto [plant, scene_graph] = AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(&builder, 0.0);
///   ...
///   plant.DoFoo(...);
///   scene_graph.DoBar(...);
/// @endcode
/// This is the easiest way to use both the plant and scene_graph.
///
/// Assign to already-declared pointer variables:
/// @code
///   MultibodyPlant<double>* plant{};
///   SceneGraph<double>* scene_graph{};
///   std::tie(plant, scene_graph) =
///       AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(&builder, 0.0 /* time_step */);

/// <!--TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI): update this comment as the number of SceneGraph

///
/// Before any geometry registration takes place, a user **must** first make a

///
/// %Multibodyplant declares an input port for geometric queries, see

 @anchor accessing_contact_properties
               #### Accessing point contact parameters
 %MultibodyPlant's point contact model looks for model parameters stored as
 geometry::ProximityProperties by geometry::SceneGraph. These properties can
 be obtained before or after context creation through
 geometry::SceneGraphInspector APIs as outlined below. %MultibodyPlant expects
 the following properties for point contact modeling:

 | Group name |   Property Name  | Required |    Property Type   | Property Description |
 | :--------: | :--------------: | :------: | :----------------: | :------------------- |
 |  material  | coulomb_friction |   yes¹   | CoulombFriction<T> | Static and Dynamic friction. |
 |  material  | point_contact_stiffness |  no²  | T | Penalty method stiffness. |
 |  material  | hunt_crossley_dissipation |  no²  | T | Penalty method dissipation. |


 ¹ Collision geometry is required to be registered with a
   geometry::ProximityProperties object that contains the
   ("material", "coulomb_friction") property. If the property
   is missing, %MultibodyPlant will throw an exeception.

 ² If the property is missing, %MultibodyPlant will use
   a heuristic value as the default. Refer to the
   section @ref mbp_penalty_method "Penalty method point contact" for further
   details.

 Accessing and modifying contact properties requires interfacing with
 geometry::SceneGraph's model inspector. Interfacing with a model inspector
 obtained from geometry::SceneGraph will provide the default registered
 values for a given parameter. These are the values that will
 initially appear in a systems::Context created by CreateDefaultContext().
 Subsequently, true system parameters can be accessed and changed through a
 systems::Context once available. For both of the above cases, proximity
 properties are accessed through geometry::SceneGraphInspector APIs.

 Before context creation an inspector can be retrieved directly from SceneGraph
 as:
 @code
 // For a SceneGraph<T> instance called scene_graph.
 const geometry::SceneGraphInspector<T>& inspector =
     scene_graph.model_inspector();
 @endcode
 After context creation, an inspector can be retrieved from the state
 stored in the context by the plant's geometry query input port:
 @code
 // For a MultibodyPlant<T> instance called mbp and a
 // Context<T> called context.
 const geometry::QueryObject<T>& query_object =
     mbp.get_geometry_query_input_port()
         .template Eval<geometry::QueryObject<T>>(context);
 const geometry::SceneGraphInspector<T>& inspector =
     query_object.inspector();
 @endcode
 Once an inspector is available, proximity properties can be retrieved as:
 @code
 // For a body with GeometryId called geometry_id
 const geometry::ProximityProperties* props =
     inspector.GetProximityProperties(geometry_id);
 const CoulombFriction<T>& geometry_friction =
     props->GetProperty<CoulombFriction<T>>("material",
                                            "coulomb_friction");
 @endcode

///               ### Working with %MultibodyElement parameters

/// modification of some aspects of the plant's model, post systems::Context
/// creation. For details, refer to the docmentation for the MultibodyElement

///
///   // Modify the body parameter for spatial inertia.
///   body.SetSpatialInertiaInBodyFrame(&context, M_BBo_B_new);

///
/// Another example, working with automatic differentiation in order to take
/// derivatives with respect to one of the bodies' masses:
/// @code
///   MultibodyPlant<double> plant;
///   // ... Code to add bodies, finalize plant, and to obtain a

///
///   // Scalar convert the plant.

///
///   const RigidBody<AutoDiffXd>& body =
///       plant_autodiff->GetRigidBodyByName("BodyName");

  /// The following geometry methods provide a convenient means for associating
  /// geometries with bodies. Ultimately, the geometries are owned by
  /// @ref geometry::SceneGraph "SceneGraph". These methods do the work of
  /// registering the requested geometries with SceneGraph and maintaining a
  /// mapping between the body and the registered data. Particularly, SceneGraph
  /// knows nothing about the concepts inherent in the %MultibodyPlant. These
  /// methods account for those differences as documented below.
  ///
  /// <h4>Geometry registration with roles</h4>
  ///
  /// Geometries can be associated with bodies via the `RegisterFooGeometry`
  /// family of methods. In SceneGraph, geometries have @ref geometry_roles
  /// "roles". The `RegisterCollisionGeometry()` methods register geometry with
  /// SceneGraph and assign it the proximity role. The
  /// `RegisterVisualGeometry()` methods do the same, but assign the
  /// illustration role.
  ///
  /// All geometry registration methods return a @ref geometry::GeometryId
  /// GeometryId. This is how SceneGraph refers to the geometries. The
  /// properties of an individual geometry can be accessed with its id and
  /// geometry::SceneGraphInspector and geometry::QueryObject (for its
  /// state-dependent pose in world).
  ///
  /// <h4>%Body frames and SceneGraph frames</h4>
  ///
  /// The first time a geometry registration method is called on a particular
  /// body, that body's frame B is registered with SceneGraph. As SceneGraph
  /// knows nothing about bodies, in the SceneGraph domain, the frame is simply
  /// notated as F; this is merely an alias for the body frame. Thus, the pose
  /// of the geometry G in the SceneGraph frame F is the same as the pose of the
  /// geometry in the body frame B; `X_FG = X_BG`.
  ///
  /// The model instance index of the body is passed to the SceneGraph frame as
  /// its "frame group". This can be retrieved from the
  /// geometry::SceneGraphInspector::GetFrameGroup(FrameId) method.
  ///
  /// Given a GeometryId, SceneGraph cannot report what _body_ it is affixed to.
  /// It can only report the SceneGraph alias frame F. But the following idiom
  /// can report the body:
  ///
  /// ```
  /// const MultibodyPlant<T>& plant = ...;
  /// const SceneGraphInspector<T>& inspector =  ...;
  /// const GeometryId g_id = id_from_some_query;
  /// const FrameId f_id = inspector.GetFrameId(g_id);
  /// const Body<T>* body = plant.GetBodyFromFrameId(f_id);
  /// ```
  /// See documentation of geometry::SceneGraphInspector on where to get an
  /// inspector.
  ///
  /// In %MultibodyPlant, frame names only have to be unique in a single
  /// model instance. However, SceneGraph knows nothing of model instances. So,
  /// to generate unique names for the corresponding frames in SceneGraph,
  /// when %MultibodyPlant registers the corresponding SceneGraph frame, it is
  /// named with a "scoped name". This is a concatenation of
  /// `[model instance name]::[body name]`. Searching for a frame with just the
  /// name `body name` will fail. (See Body::name() and GetModelInstanceName()

  ///
  /// To understand how material properties enter into the modeling of contact
  /// traction in the hydroelastic model, the user is referred to [R. Elandt
  /// 2019] for details.
  /// For brevity, here we limit ourselves to state the relationship between the
  /// material properties and the computation of the normal traction or
  /// "pressure" `p(x)` at each point `x` in the contact patch.
  /// Given two bodies A and B, with elastic moduli `Eᵃ` and `Eᵇ` respectively
  /// and dissipation `dᵃ` and `dᵇ` respectively, we define the effective
  /// material properties of the pair according to: <pre>
  ///   E = Eᵃ⋅Eᵇ/(Eᵃ + Eᵇ),
  ///   d = E/Eᵃ⋅dᵃ + E/Eᵇ⋅dᵇ = Eᵇ/(Eᵃ+Eᵇ)⋅dᵃ + Eᵃ/(Eᵃ+Eᵇ)⋅dᵇ
  /// </pre>
  /// The effective modulus of elasticity is computed in accordance with the
  /// Hertz theory of contact. Dissipation is weighted in accordance with the
  /// fact that the softer material will deform more and faster and thus the
  /// softer material dissipation is given more importance. Elastic modulus has
  /// units of pressure, i.e. `Pa (N/m²)`. The elastic modulus is often
  /// estimated based on the Young's modulus of the material though in the
  /// hydroelastic model it represents an effective elastic property. For
  /// instance, [R. Elandt 2019] chooses to use `E = G`, with `G` the P-wave
  /// elastic modulus `G = (1-ν)/(1+ν)/(1-2ν)E`, with ν the Poisson
  /// ratio, consistent with the theory of layered solids in which plane
  /// sections remain planar after compression. Another possibility is to
  /// specify `E = E*`, with `E*` the effective elastic modulus given by the
  /// Hertz theory of contact, `E* = E/(1-ν²)`. In all of these cases a sound
  /// estimation of `elastic_modulus` starts with the Young's modulus of the
  /// material.
  ///
  /// We use a dissipation model inspired by the model in
  /// [Hunt and Crossley, 1975], parameterized by a dissipation constant with
  /// units of inverse of velocity, i.e. `s/m`.
  ///
  /// The elastic modulus and dissipation can be specified in one of two ways:

  /// - define them in an instance of geometry::ProximityProperties using
  ///   the function geometry::AddContactMaterial(), or
  /// - define them in an input URDF/SDF as detailed @ref sdf_contact_material
  ///   "here for SDF" or @ref urdf_contact_material "here for URDF".
  ///
  /// With the effective properties of the pair defined as above, the
  /// hydroelastic model pressure field is computed according to:
  /// <pre>
  ///   p(x) = E⋅ε(x)⋅(1 - d⋅vₙ(x))₊
  /// </pre>
  /// where we defined the effective strain: <pre>
  ///   ε(x) = εᵃ(x) + εᵇ(x)

  /// </pre>
  /// that is, the hydroelastic model computes the contact patch assuming
  /// quasi-static equilibrium.
  /// The separation speed `vₙ(x)` is computed as the component in the

  /// between points `Ax` and `Bx` at point `x` instantaneously moving with body

  ///
  /// Currently %MultibodyPlant uses a rigid contact model that is, bodies in
  /// the model are infinitely stiff or ideal rigid bodies. Therefore, the
  /// mathematical description of the rigid contact model needs to include
  /// non-penetration constraints among bodies in the formulation. There are
  /// several numerical methods to impose and solve these constraints.
  /// In a penalty method approach, we allow for a certain amount of
  /// interpenetration and we compute contact forces according to a simple law
  /// of the form: <pre>
  ///   fₙ = k(1+dẋ)x
  /// </pre>
  /// where the normal contact force `fₙ` is made a continuous function of the
  /// penetration distance x between the bodies (defined to be
  /// positive when the bodies are in contact) and the penetration distance
  /// rate ẋ (with ẋ > 0 meaning the penetration distance is increasing and
  /// therefore the interpenetration between the bodies is also increasing).
  /// k and d are the combined penalty method coefficients for stiffness and
  /// dissipation, given a pair of colliding geometries.
  /// For flexibility of parameterization, stiffness and dissipation are set on
  /// a per-geometry basis (@ref accessing_contact_properties). Given two
  /// geometries with individual stiffness and dissipation parameters (k₁, d₁)
  /// and (k₂, d₂), we define the rule for combined stiffness (k) and
  /// dissipation (d) as: <pre>
  ///     k = (k₁⋅k₂)/(k₁+k₂)
  ///     d = (k₂/(k₁+k₂))⋅d₁ + (k₁/(k₁+k₂))⋅d₂
  /// </pre>
  /// These parameters are optional for each geometry. For any geometry not
  /// assigned these parameters by a user Pre-Finalize, %MultibodyPlant will
  /// assign default values such that the combined parameters of two geometries
  /// with default values match those estimated using the user-supplied
  /// "penetration allowance", as described below.
  ///
  /// These are ad-hoc parameters which need to be tuned as a trade-off between:
  /// - The accuracy of the numerical approximation to rigid contact, which
  ///   requires a stiffness that approaches infinity, and
  /// - the computational cost of the numerical integration, which will
  ///   require smaller time steps for stiffer systems.
  ///
  ///
  /// There is no exact procedure for choosing these coefficients, and
  /// estimating them manually can be cumbersome since in general they will
  /// depend on the scale of the problem including masses, speeds and even
  /// body sizes. However, %MultibodyPlant aids the estimation of these
  /// coefficients using a heuristic function based on a user-supplied
  /// "penetration allowance", see set_penetration_allowance(). The penetration
  /// allowance is a number in meters that specifies the order of magnitude of
  /// the average penetration between bodies in the system that the user is
  /// willing to accept as reasonable for the problem being solved. For
  /// instance, in the robotics manipulation of ordinary daily objects the user
  /// might set this number to 1 millimeter. However, the user might want to
  /// increase it for the simulation of heavy walking robots for which an
  /// allowance of 1 millimeter would result in a very stiff system.
  ///
  /// As for the dissipation coefficient in the simple law above,
  /// %MultibodyPlant chooses the dissipation coefficient d to model inelastic
  /// collisions and therefore sets it so that the penetration distance x
  /// behaves as a critically damped oscillator. That is, at the limit of ideal
  /// rigid contact (very stiff penalty coefficient k or equivalently the
  /// penetration allowance goes to zero), this method behaves as a unilateral
  /// constraint on the penetration distance, which models a perfect inelastic
  /// collision. For most applications, such as manipulation and walking, this
  /// is the desired behavior.
  ///
  /// When set_penetration_allowance() is called, %MultibodyPlant will estimate
  /// reasonable penalty method coefficients as a function of the input
  /// penetration allowance. Users will want to run their simulation a number of
  /// times and assess they are satisfied with the level of inter-penetration
  /// actually observed in the simulation; if the observed penetration is too
  /// large, the user will want to set a smaller penetration allowance. If the
  /// system is too stiff and the time integration requires very small time
  /// steps while at the same time the user can afford larger
  /// inter-penetrations, the user will want to increase the penetration
  /// allowance. Typically, the observed penetration will be
  /// proportional to the penetration allowance. Thus scaling the penetration
  /// allowance by say a factor of 0.5, would typically results in
  /// inter-penetrations being reduced by the same factor of 0.5.
  /// In summary, users should choose the largest penetration allowance that
  /// results in inter-penetration levels that are acceptable for the particular
  /// application (even when in theory this penetration should be zero for
  /// perfectly rigid bodies.)
  ///
  /// For a given penetration allowance, the contact interaction that takes two
  /// bodies with a non-zero approaching velocity to zero approaching velocity,
  /// takes place in a finite amount of time (for ideal rigid contact this time
  /// is zero.) A good estimate of this time period is given by a call to
  /// get_contact_penalty_method_time_scale(). Users might want to query this
