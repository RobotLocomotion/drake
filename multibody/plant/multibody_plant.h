/// @anchor model_instances
///                         ### Model Instances
///
/// A MultiBodyPlant may contain multiple model instances. Each model instance
/// corresponds to a
/// set of bodies and their connections (joints). Model instances provide
/// methods to get or set the state of the set of bodies (e.g., through
/// GetPositionsAndVelocities() and SetPositionsAndVelocities()), connecting
/// controllers (through get_state_output_port()
/// and get_actuation_input_port()), and organizing duplicate models (read
/// through a parser). In fact, many %MultibodyPlant methods are overloaded
/// to allow operating on the entire plant or just the subset corresponding to
/// the model instance; for example, one GetPositions() method obtains the
/// generalized positions for the entire plant while another GetPositions()
/// method obtains the generalized positions for model instance.
///
/// Model instances are frequently defined through SDF files
/// (using the `model` tag) and are automatically created when SDF
/// files are parsed (by Parser). There are two special
/// multibody::ModelInstanceIndex values. The world body is always
/// multibody::ModelInstanceIndex 0. multibody::ModelInstanceIndex 1 is
/// reserved for all elements with no explicit model instance and
/// is generally only relevant for elements
/// created programmatically (and only when a model instance is not explicitly
/// specified). Note that Parser creates model instances (resulting in a
/// multibody::ModelInstanceIndex ≥ 2) as needed.
///
/// See num_model_instances(),
/// num_positions(),
/// num_velocities(), num_actuated_dofs(),
/// AddModelInstance() GetPositionsAndVelocities(),
/// GetPositions(), GetVelocities(),
/// SetPositionsAndVelocities(),
/// SetPositions(), SetVelocities(),
/// GetPositionsFromArray(), GetVelocitiesFromArray(),
/// SetPositionsInArray(), SetVelocitiesInArray(), SetActuationInArray(),
/// HasModelInstanceNamed(), GetModelInstanceName(),
/// get_state_output_port(),
/// get_actuation_input_port().
///
/// @anchor mbp_equations_of_motion
///                         ### System dynamics
///
/// <!-- TODO(amcastro-tri): Update this documentation to include:
///      - Bilateral constraints.
///      - Unilateral constraints and contact. -->
///
/// The state of a multibody system `x = [q; v]` is given by its generalized
/// positions vector q, of size `nq` (see num_positions()), and by its
/// generalized velocities vector v, of size `nv` (see num_velocities()).
/// As a Drake @ref systems::System "System", %MultibodyPlant implements the
/// governing equations for a
/// multibody dynamical system in the form `ẋ = f(t, x, u)` with t being
/// time and u the actuation forces. The governing equations for
/// the dynamics of a multibody system modeled with %MultibodyPlant are
/// [Featherstone 2008, Jain 2010]: <pre>
///          q̇ = N(q)v
///   (1)    M(q)v̇ + C(q, v)v = τ
/// </pre>
/// where `M(q)` is the mass matrix of the multibody system, `C(q, v)v`
/// contains Coriolis, centripetal, and gyroscopic terms and
/// `N(q)` is the kinematic coupling matrix describing the relationship between
/// q̇ (the time derivatives of the generalized positions) and the generalized
/// velocities v, [Seth 2010]. `N(q)` is an `nq x nv` matrix.
/// The vector `τ ∈ ℝⁿᵛ` on the right hand side of Eq. (1) is
/// the system's generalized forces. These incorporate gravity, springs,
/// externally applied body forces, constraint forces, and contact forces.
///
/// @anchor sdf_loading
///                  ### Loading models from SDF files
///
/// Drake has the capability to load multibody models from SDF and URDF
/// files.  Consider the example below which loads an acrobot model:
/// @code
///   MultibodyPlant<T> acrobot;
///   SceneGraph<T> scene_graph;
///   Parser parser(&acrobot, &scene_graph);
///   const std::string relative_name =
///     "drake/multibody/benchmarks/acrobot/acrobot.sdf";
///   const std::string full_name = FindResourceOrThrow(relative_name);
///   parser.AddModelFromFile(full_name);
/// @endcode
/// As in the example above, for models including visual geometry, collision
/// geometry or both, the user must specify a SceneGraph for geometry handling.
/// You can find a full example of the LQR controlled acrobot in
/// examples/multibody/acrobot/run_lqr.cc.
///
/// AddModelFromFile() can be invoked multiple times on the same plant in order
/// to load multiple model instances.  Other methods are available on Parser
/// such as AddAllModelsFromFile() which allows creating model instances per
/// each `<model>` tag found in the file. Please refer to each of these
/// methods' documentation for further details.
///
/// @anchor mbp_adding_elements
///                    ### Adding modeling elements
///
/// <!-- TODO(amcastro-tri): Update this section to add force elements and
///      constraints. -->
///
/// Add multibody elements to a %MultibodyPlant with methods like:
///
/// - Bodies: AddRigidBody()
/// - Joints: AddJoint()
/// - see @ref mbp_construction "Construction" for more.
///
/// All modeling elements **must** be added before Finalize() is called.
/// See @ref mbp_finalize_stage "Finalize stage" for a discussion.
///
/// @anchor mbp_geometry_registration
///               ### Registering geometry with a SceneGraph
///
/// %MultibodyPlant users can register geometry with a SceneGraph for
/// essentially two purposes; a) visualization and, b) contact modeling.
///
/// <!--TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI): update this comment as the number of SceneGraph
///     roles changes. -->
///
/// Before any geometry registration takes place, a user **must** first make a
/// call to RegisterAsSourceForSceneGraph() in order to register the
/// %MultibodyPlant as a client of a SceneGraph instance, point at which the
/// plant will have assigned a valid geometry::SourceId.
/// At Finalize(), %MultibodyPlant will declare input/output ports as
/// appropriate to communicate with the SceneGraph instance on which
/// registrations took place. All geometry registration **must** be performed
/// pre-finalize.
///
/// If %MultibodyPlant registers geometry with a SceneGraph via calls to
/// RegisterCollisionGeometry(), an input port for geometric queries will be
/// declared at Finalize() time, see get_geometry_query_input_port(). Users must
/// connect this input port to the output port for geometric queries of the
/// SceneGraph used for registration, which can be obtained with
/// SceneGraph::get_query_output_port().
/// In summary, if %MultibodyPlant registers collision geometry, the setup
/// process will include:
///
/// 1. Call to RegisterAsSourceForSceneGraph().
/// 2. Calls to RegisterCollisionGeometry(), as many as needed.
/// 3. Call to Finalize(), user is done specifying the model.
/// 4. Connect SceneGraph::get_query_output_port() to
///    get_geometry_query_input_port().
///
/// Refer to the documentation provided in each of the methods above for further
/// details.
///
/// @anchor mbp_modeling_contact
///                           ### Modeling contact
///
/// Please refer to @ref drake_contacts "Contact Modeling in Drake" for details
/// on the available approximations, setup, and considerations for a multibody
/// simulation with frictional contact.
///
/// @anchor mbp_finalize_stage
///                            ### %Finalize() stage
///
/// Once the user is done adding modeling elements and registering geometry, a
/// call to Finalize() must be performed. This call will:
/// - Build the underlying MultibodyTree topology, see MultibodyTree::Finalize()
///   for details,
/// - declare the plant's state,
/// - declare the plant's input and output ports,
/// - declare input and output ports for communication with a SceneGraph.
///
/// <!-- TODO(amcastro-tri): Consider making the actual geometry registration
///      with GS AFTER Finalize() so that we can tell if there are any bodies
///      welded to the world to which we could just assign anchored geometry
///      instead of dynamic geometry. This is an optimization and the API, and
///      pre/post-finalize conditions should not change. -->

  /// The following geometry methods provide a convenient means for associating
  /// geometries with bodies. Ultimately, the geometries are owned by
  /// @ref geometry::SceneGraph "SceneGraph". These methods do the work of
  /// registering the requested geometries with SceneGraph and maintaining a
  /// mapping between the body and the registered data. Particularly, SceneGraph
  /// knows nothing about the concepts inherent in the %MultibodyPlant. These
  /// methods account for those differences as documented below.
  ///
  /// <h4>Geometry registration with roles</h4>
  ///
  /// Geometries can be associated with bodies via the `RegisterXXXGeometry`
  /// family of methods. In SceneGraph, geometries have @ref geometry_roles
  /// "roles". The `RegisterCollisionGeometry()` methods register geometry with
  /// SceneGraph and assign it the proximity role. The
  /// `RegisterVisualGeometry()` methods do the same, but assign the
  /// illustration role.
  ///
  /// All geometry registration methods return a @ref geometry::GeometryId
  /// GeometryId. This is how SceneGraph refers to the geometries. The
  /// properties of an individual geometry can be accessed with its id and
  /// geometry::SceneGraphInspector and geometry::QueryObject (for its
  /// state-dependent pose in world).
  ///
  /// <h4>%Body frames and SceneGraph frames</h4>
  ///
  /// The first time a geometry registration method is called on a particular
  /// body, that body's frame B is registered with SceneGraph. As SceneGraph
  /// knows nothing about bodies, in the SceneGraph domain, the frame is simply
  /// notated as F; this is merely an alias for the body frame. Thus, the pose
  /// of the geometry G in the SceneGraph frame F is the same as the pose of the
  /// geometry in the body frame B; `X_FG = X_BG`.
  ///
  /// The model instance index of the body is passed to the SceneGraph frame as
  /// its "frame group". This can be retrieved from the
  /// geometry::SceneGraphInspector::GetFrameGroup(FrameId) method.
  ///
  /// Given a GeometryId, SceneGraph cannot report what _body_ it is affixed to.
  /// It can only report the SceneGraph alias frame F. But the following idiom
  /// can report the body:
  ///
  /// ```
  /// const MultibodyPlant<T>& plant = ...;
  /// const SceneGraphInspector<T>& inspector =  ...;
  /// const GeometryId g_id = id_from_some_query;
  /// const FrameId f_id = inspector.GetFrameId(g_id);
  /// const Body<T>* body = plant.GetBodyFromFrameId(f_id);
  /// ```
  /// See documentation of geometry::SceneGraphInspector on where to get an
  /// inspector.
  ///
  /// In %MultibodyPlant, frame names only have to be unique in a single
  /// model instance. However, SceneGraph knows nothing of model instances. So,
  /// to generate unique names for the corresponding frames in SceneGraph,
  /// when %MultibodyPlant registers the corresponding SceneGraph frame, it is
  /// named with a "scoped name". This is a concatenation of
  /// `[model instance name]::[body name]`. Searching for a frame with just the

  ///                   #### Penalty method point contact
  ///
  /// Currently %MultibodyPlant uses a rigid contact model that is, bodies in
  /// the model are infinitely stiff or ideal rigid bodies. Therefore, the
  /// mathematical description of the rigid contact model needs to include
  /// non-penetration constraints among bodies in the formulation. There are
  /// several numerical methods to impose and solve these constraints.
  /// In a penalty method approach, we allow for a certain amount of
  /// interpenetration and we compute contact forces according to a simple law
  /// of the form: <pre>
  ///   fₙ = k(1+dẋ)x
  /// </pre>
  /// where the normal contact force `fₙ` is made a continuous function of the
  /// penetration distance x between the bodies (defined to be
  /// positive when the bodies are in contact) and the penetration distance
  /// rate ẋ (with ẋ > 0 meaning the penetration distance is increasing and
  /// therefore the interpenetration between the bodies is also increasing).
  /// k and d are the penalty method coefficients for stiffness and damping.
  /// These are ad-hoc parameters which need to be tuned as a trade-off between:
  /// - The accuracy of the numerical approximation to rigid contact, which
  ///   requires a stiffness that approaches infinity, and
  /// - the computational cost of the numerical integration, which will
  ///   require smaller time steps for stiffer systems.
  ///
  /// There is no exact procedure for choosing these coefficients, and
  /// estimating them manually can be cumbersome since in general they will
  /// depend on the scale of the problem including masses, speeds and even
  /// body sizes. However, %MultibodyPlant aids the estimation of these
  /// coefficients using a heuristic function based on a user-supplied
  /// "penetration allowance", see set_penetration_allowance(). The penetration
  /// allowance is a number in meters that specifies the order of magnitude of
  /// the average penetration between bodies in the system that the user is
  /// willing to accept as reasonable for the problem being solved. For
  /// instance, in the robotics manipulation of ordinary daily objects the user
  /// might set this number to 1 millimeter. However, the user might want to
  /// increase it for the simulation of heavy walking robots for which an
  /// allowance of 1 millimeter would result in a very stiff system.
  ///
  /// As for the damping coefficient in the simple law above, %MultibodyPlant
  /// chooses the damping coefficient d to model inelastic collisions and
  /// therefore sets it so that the penetration distance x behaves as a
  /// critically damped oscillator. That is, at the limit of ideal rigid contact
  /// (very stiff penalty coefficient k or equivalently the penetration
  /// allowance goes to zero), this method behaves as a unilateral constraint on
  /// the penetration distance, which models a perfect inelastic collision. For
  /// most applications, such as manipulation and walking, this is the desired
  /// behavior.
  ///
  /// When set_penetration_allowance() is called, %MultibodyPlant will estimate
  /// reasonable penalty method coefficients as a function of the input
  /// penetration allowance. Users will want to run their simulation a number of
  /// times and asses they are satisfied with the level of inter-penetration
  /// actually observed in the simulation; if the observed penetration is too
  /// large, the user will want to set a smaller penetration allowance. If the
  /// system is too stiff and the time integration requires very small time
  /// steps while at the same time the user can afford larger
  /// inter-penetrations, the user will want to increase the penetration
  /// allowance. Typically, the observed penetration will be
  /// proportional to the penetration allowance. Thus scaling the penetration
  /// allowance by say a factor of 0.5, would typically results in
  /// inter-penetrations being reduced by the same factor of 0.5.
  /// In summary, users should choose the largest penetration allowance that
  /// results in inter-penetration levels that are acceptable for the particular
  /// application (even when in theory this penetration should be zero for
  /// perfectly rigid bodies.)
  ///
  /// For a given penetration allowance, the contact interaction that takes two
  /// bodies with a non-zero approaching velocity to zero approaching velocity,
  /// takes place in a finite amount of time (for ideal rigid contact this time
  /// is zero.) A good estimate of this time period is given by a call to
  /// get_contact_penalty_method_time_scale(). Users might want to query this
  /// value to either set the maximum time step in error-controlled time
  /// integration or to set the time step for fixed time step integration.
  /// As a guidance, typical fixed time step integrators will become unstable
  /// for time steps larger than about a tenth of this time scale.
