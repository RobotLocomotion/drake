// This class is meant to perform all calculations needed to advance state for a
// MultibodyPlant with discrete state.
// It is an interface class that MultibodyPlant knows how to invoke. As of today
// a new manager can be set with the experimental method
// MultibodyPlant::set_contact_computation_manager(). This allows Drake
// developers to experiment with a variety of time stepping methods.
// In addition, managers have the chance to declare additional state, cache
// and/or ports. This allows developers to incorporate additional discrete
// models coupled with the rigid body dynamics. For instance simulation of
// deformable objects requires additional state and ports to interact with
// externals systems such as visualization.
// We can think of ContactComputationManager as an extension of MultibodyPlant
// but in a different compilation unit, in that we are still allowed to access
// MultibodyPlant's private members and methods as needed.
// A manager can get access to private methods and/or members through a
// internal::MultibodyPlantAccess object, refer to MultibodyPlantAccess class's
// documention for details.
