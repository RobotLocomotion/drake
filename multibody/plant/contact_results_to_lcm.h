 unique within MBP. So, for two bodies which may be identically named (body
 name), they *must* differ by model name. For a body that has multiple collision
 geometries, we rely on the fact that every collision geometry for a single
 frame must be uniquely named.

 This includes further information to allow visualizers to make streamlining
 decisions. It reports if the body name is unique across the entire plant
 (body_name_is_unique) and the number of collision geometries associated
 with the body.

 If the body name is unique, the visualizer can display only the body
 name without fear of introducing ambiguity. Furthermore, with the number
 collision geometries per body, the visualizer can draw conclusions about
 the possible number of contact patches between bodies and streamline
 accordingly. */

/** A System that encodes ContactResults into a lcmt_contact_results_for_viz
 message. It has a single input port with type ContactResults<T> and a single
 output port with lcmt_contact_results_for_viz.

 Although this class can be instantiated on all default scalars, its
 functionality will be limited for `T` = symbolic::Expression. If there are any
 symbolic::Variable instances in the expression, attempting to evaluate the
 output port will throw an exception. The support is sufficient that a
 systems::Diagram with a %ContactResultsToLcmSystem can be scalar converted to
 symbolic::Expression without error, but not necessarily evaluated.

 <h3>Constructing instances</h3>

 Generally, you shouldn't construct %ContactResultsToLcmSystem instances
 directly. We recommend using one of the overloaded
 @ref contact_result_vis_creation "ConnectContactResultsToDrakeVisualizer()"
 functions to add contact visualization to your diagram.

 <h3>How contacts are described in visualization</h3>

 In the visualizer, each contact between two bodies is uniquely characterized
 by two triples of names: (model instance name, body name, geometry name).
 These triples help distinguish contacts which might otherwise be ambiguous
 (e.g., contact with two bodies, both called "box" but part of different model
 instances).

 %ContactResultsToLcmSystem gets the model instance and body names from an
 instance of MultibodyPlant, but *geometry* names are not available from the
 plant. By default, %ContactResultsToLcmSystem will *generate* a unique name
 based on a geometry's unique id (e.g., "Id(7)"). For many applications
 (those cases where each body has only a single collision geometry), this is
 perfectly acceptable. However, in cases where a body has multiple collision
 geometries, those default names may not be helpful when viewing the visualized
 results. Instead, %ContactResultsToLcmSystem can use the names associated with
 the id in a geometry::SceneGraph instance. The only method for doing this is
 via the @ref contact_result_vis_creation
 "ConnectContactResultsToDrakeVisualizer()" functions and requires the diagram
 to be instantiated as double valued. If a diagram with a different scalar
 type is required, it should subsequently be scalar converted.

/** @name Visualizing contact results
 @anchor contact_result_vis_creation

 These functions extend a Diagram with the required components to publish
 contact results (as reported by MultibodyPlant) to a visualizer (either Meldis
 or the legacy ``drake_visualizer`` application of days past). We recommend
 using these functions instead of assembling the requisite components by hand.

 These must be called _during_ Diagram building. Each function makes
 modifications to the diagram being constructed by `builder` including the
 following changes:

 - adds systems multibody::ContactResultsToLcmSystem and LcmPublisherSystem to
   the Diagram and connects the draw message output to the publisher input,
 - connects a ContactResults<double>-valued output port to the
   ContactResultsToLcmSystem system, and
 - sets the publishing rate based on publish_period.

 The two overloads differ in the following way:

  - One overload takes an OutputPort and one doesn't. This determines what is
    connected to the ContactResultsToLcmSystem input port. The overload that
    specifies an OutputPort will attempt to connect that port. The one that
    doesn't will connect the given plant's contact results output port.

 The parameters have the following semantics:

 @param builder                The diagram builder being used to construct the
                               Diagram. Systems will be added to this builder.
 @param plant                  The System in `builder` containing the plant
                               whose contact results are to be visualized.
 @param scene_graph            The SceneGraph that will determine how the
                               geometry names will appear in the lcm message.
 @param publish_period         An optional period to pass along to the
                               LcmPublisherSystem constructor; when null, a
                               reasonable default period will be used.
 @param lcm                    An optional lcm interface through which lcm
                               messages will be dispatched. Will be allocated
                               internally if none is supplied. If one is given,
                               it must remain alive at least as long as the
                               diagram built from `builder`.
 @param contact_results_port   The optional port that will be connected to the
                               ContactResultsToLcmSystem (as documented above).

 @returns (for all overloads) the LcmPublisherSystem (in case callers, e.g.,
          need to change the default publishing rate).

 @pre `plant` is contained within the supplied `builder`.
 @pre `scene_graph` is contained with the supplied `builder`.
 @pre `contact_results_port` (if given) belongs to a system that is an immediate
      child of `builder`. */
