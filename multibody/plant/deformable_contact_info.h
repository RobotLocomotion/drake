/** A class containing information regarding contact and contact response
 between two geometries belonging to a pair of bodies with at least one of them
 being a deformable body. This class provides:

    - The shared contact mesh between the two geometries.
    - The tractions acting at the contact points on the contact mesh.
    - The slip speeds at the contact points on the contact mesh.
    - The spatial force from the integrated tractions that is applied at the
      centroid of the contact surface.

 The two geometries are denoted as A and B respectively with geometry A
 guaranteed to be belonging to a deformable body.
