 Denoting with k₁ and k₂ the `stiffness_A` and `stiffness_B` respectively, and
 with d₁ and d₂ the Hunt & Crossley dissipation coefficients for geometries A
 and B respectively, this method computes the combined dissipation according to
 the rule:
   d = k₂/(k₁+k₂)⋅d₁ + k₁/(k₁+k₂)⋅d₂
 This method requires both values of stiffness coefficients to be positive
 or zero, and it allows one, but only one value, to be infinite. That
 is, one of the geometries can be rigid but not both. For such case, the
 combined dissipation corresponds to the mathematical limit in the expression
 above, i.e., it is the dissipation of the non-rigid geometry.
 If both values of stiffness are zero, zero dissipation is returned.

 @pre stiffness_A >= 0. It can have the value infinity, indicating a rigid
 geometry A.
 @pre stiffness_B >= 0. It can have the value infinity, indicating a rigid
 geometry B.
 @pre At least one of A or B is non-rigid.
 @pre default_dissipation >= 0. Default value of dissipation for both geometries
 in case no value was assigned in the proximity properties. */
