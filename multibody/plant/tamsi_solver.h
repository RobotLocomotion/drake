// This struct implements the Transition-Aware Line Search (TALS) algorithm as
// described in @ref castro_etal_2019 "[Castro et al., 2019]".
// TamsiSolver performs a Newton-Raphson iteration, and at each kth iteration,
// it computes a tangential velocity update Δvₜᵏ. One Newton strategy would be
// to compute the tangential velocity at the next iteration (k+1) as vₜᵏ⁺¹ =
// vₜᵏ + αΔvₜᵏ, where 0 < α < 1, is a coefficient obtained by line search to
// improve convergence.
// Line search works very well for smooth problems. However, even though TAMSI
// is solving the root of a continuous function, this function has very steep
// gradients only within the very small regions close to where the tangential
// velocities are zero. These regions are circles in ℝ² of radius equal to the
// stiction tolerance of the solver vₛ. We refer to these circular regions as
// the "stiction regions" and to their boundaries as the "stiction circles". We
// refer to the region of ℝ² outside the stiction region around the origin as
// the "sliding region".
// TamsiSolver uses the following regularized friction function
// μₛ with slip speed: <pre>
//     μₛ(x) = ⌈ μ x (2 - x),  x  < 1
//             ⌊ μ          ,  x >= 1
// </pre>
// where x corresponds to the dimensionless slip speed x = ‖vₜ‖ / vₛ and
// μ is the Coulomb's law coefficient of friction. The TAMSI solver makes no
// distinction between static and dynamic coefficients of friction and
// therefore a single coefficient μ needs to be specified.
// Regularized friction is highly nonlinear and difficult to solve with a
// conventional Newton-Raphson method. However, it can be partitioned into
// regions based on how well the local gradients can be used to find a
// solution. We'll describe the algorithm below in terms of "strong" gradients
// (∂μ/∂v >> 0) and "weak" gradients (∂μ/∂v ≈ 0). Roughly, the gradients are
// strong during stiction and weak during sliding.
// These regions are so small compared to the velocity scales dealt with by the
// TAMSI solver, that effectively, the Newton-Raphson iterate would only "see"
// a fixed dynamic coefficient of friction and it would never be able to
// predict stiction. That is, if search direction Δvₜᵏ computed by the
// Newton-Raphson algorithm is not limited in some way, the iteration would
// never fall within the stiction regions where gradients are "strong" to guide
// the convergence of the solution, to either stiction or sliding.
//
// The remedy to this situation is to limit changes in the tangential
// velocities at each iteration. The situation described above, in which an
// update  Δvₜᵏ "misses" the stiction circle can be described in purely
// geometric terms. We exploit this fact to devise a strategy that is
// appropriate for this particular problem. We use the methodology outlined in
// @ref uchida_etal_2015 "[Uchida et al., 2015]" and describe particulars to
// our implementation below.
//
// %TalsLimiter implements a specific strategy with knowledge of the TAMSI
// solver iteration procedure. It is important to note that %TalsLimiter uses
// "soft norms" to avoid divisions by zero. That is, friction forces are
// computed according to: <pre>
//   fₜ(vₜ) = -μ(‖vₜ‖ₛ) vₜ/‖vₜ‖ₛ
// </pre>
// where, to avoid the singularity at zero velocity, we use a "soft norm"
// ‖vₜ‖ₛ = sqrt(vₜᵀvₜ + εᵥ²), with εᵥ a small fraction of vₛ. Due to the
// use of soft norms, the gradient of fₜ with vₜ is now well defined,
// but it goes to zero as vₜ approaches the origin. Therefore, gradients
// are also "weak" in the neighborhood of ‖vₜ‖ₛ ≲ εᵥ.
// Due to this, external forcing (either from applied forces or from coupling
// with other friction forces) has the potential to, mistakenly, force a
// transition from stiction to sliding. The solver will most likely recover
// from this, but this will result in a larger number of iterations.
// %TalsLimiter considers any tangential velocity vₜ (or change Δvₜ)
// to be approximately zero if x = ‖vₜ‖/vₛ is smaller than `tolerance`
// (see docs below, this is a dimensionless number << 1). We define
// `εᵥ = tolerance⋅vₛ` (with units of m/s).
//
// In what follows we list a number of special scenarios dealt with by
// %TalsLimiter. We use the observations made above.
//
// - %TalsLimiter first deals with the case ‖vₜ‖ < εᵥ to avoid
//   divisions by zero in the subsequent cases. It essentially clips vₜᵏ⁺¹
//   to have magnitude vₛ/2 when the update Δvₜᵏ ≠ 0. For small updates
//   Δvₜᵏ leading to vₜᵏ⁺¹ within the stiction region, we take  α = 1.
//   See implementation notes for CalcAlpha() for further details.
// - Transition from ‖vₜ‖ < εᵥ (stiction) to ‖vₜ‖/vₛ > 1 (sliding). Since
//   we are in a region of "weak" gradients (due to "norm softening",
//   see discussion above), we limit the update to vₜᵏ⁺¹ = vₜᵏ/‖vₜᵏ‖⋅vₛ/2.
//   In other words, if the speed would grow too fast, we cap it at vₛ/2
//   so that at least two Newton iterations are required to go from near-0
//   sticking to sliding.
// - Transition from sliding ‖vₜᵏ‖/vₛ > 1 to an almost perfect stiction with
//   ‖vₜᵏ⁺¹‖ < εᵥ. In an attempt to avoid weak gradients for the next
//   iteration, we impose the limit vₜᵏ⁺¹ = vₜᵏ/‖vₜᵏ‖⋅vₛ/2, placing the
//   velocity "in the same direction where it came from", within the stiction
//   region, but where gradients are strong.
// - Velocity change Δvₜᵏ intersects the stiction circle. To be more precise,
//   the line connecting vₜᵏ and vₜᵏ + Δvₜᵏ crosses the stiction region.
//   This situation implies that most likely a stiction transition could
//   happen but the pure Newton-Raphson would miss it. This situation is
//   outlined in @ref uchida_etal_2015 "[Uchida et al., 2015]". In this case
//   %TalsLimiter computes α so that vₜᵏ⁺¹ =  vₜᵏ + αΔvₜᵏ is the closest
//   vector to the origin. This corresponds to the geometric condition
//   dot(vₜᵏ⁺¹, Δvₜᵏ) = 0.
// - Velocity change Δvₜᵏ does not intersect the stiction circle, i.e.
//   changes happen in a region away from stiction (within the sliding
//   region). However, large angular changes (measured by the angle
//   θ = acos(vₜᵏ⁺¹⋅vₜᵏ/(‖vₜᵏ⁺¹‖‖vₜᵏ‖)) between vₜᵏ⁺¹ and vₜᵏ)
//   might indicate a solution that is attempting to reach a stiction region.
//   In order to aid convergence, we limit the angle change to θₘₐₓ, and
//   therefore (see @ref uchida_etal_2015 "[Uchida et al., 2015]") we compute α
//   so that θₘₐₓ = acos(vₜᵏ⁺¹⋅vₜᵏ/(‖vₜᵏ⁺¹‖‖vₜᵏ‖)).
//

// inside a struct so that we can use Eigen::Ref arguments allowing different

/** @anchor tamsi_class_intro
%TamsiSolver uses the Transition-Aware Modified Semi-Implicit (TAMSI) method,
@ref castro_etal_2019 "[Castro et al., 2019]", to solve the equations below for
mechanical systems in contact with regularized friction:
@verbatim
            q̇ = N(q) v
  (1)  M(q) v̇ = τ + Jₙᵀ(q) fₙ(q, v) + Jₜᵀ(q) fₜ(q, v)
@endverbatim
where `v ∈ ℝⁿᵛ` is the vector of generalized velocities, `M(q) ∈ ℝⁿᵛˣⁿᵛ` is
the mass matrix, `Jₙ(q) ∈ ℝⁿᶜˣⁿᵛ` is the Jacobian of normal separation
velocities, `Jₜ(q) ∈ ℝ²ⁿᶜˣⁿᵛ` is the Jacobian of tangent velocities,
`fₙ ∈ ℝⁿᶜ` is the vector of normal contact forces, `fₜ ∈ ℝ²ⁿᶜ` is the
vector of tangent friction forces and τ ∈ ℝⁿᵛ is a vector of generalized
forces containing all other applied forces (e.g., Coriolis, gyroscopic
terms, actuator forces, etc.) but contact forces.
This solver assumes a compliant law for the normal forces `fₙ(q, v)` and
therefore the functional dependence of `fₙ(q, v)` with q and v is stated
explicitly.

Since %TamsiSolver uses regularized friction, we explicitly emphasize the
functional dependence of `fₜ(q, v)` with the generalized velocities. The
functional dependence of `fₜ(q, v)` with the generalized positions stems from
its direct dependence with the normal forces `fₙ(q, v)`.

%TamsiSolver implements two different schemes. A "one-way
coupling scheme" which solves for the friction forces given the normal
forces are known. That is, normal forces affect the computation of the
friction forces however, the normal forces are kept constant during the
solution procedure.

A "two-way coupling scheme" treats both the normal and friction forces
implicitly in the generalized velocities resulting in a numerical strategy
in which normal forces affect friction forces and, conversely, friction forces
couple back to the computation of the normal forces.

The two-way coupled scheme provides a more stable and therefore robust
solution to the problem stated in Eq. (1) with just a small increase of the
computational cost compared to the one-way coupled scheme. The one-way
coupled scheme is however very useful for testing and analysis of the
solver.

@anchor one_way_coupling_scheme
<h2>One-Way Coupling Scheme</h2>

Equation (1) is discretized in time using a variation of the first order
semi-implicit Euler scheme from step s to step s+1 with time step `δt` as:
@verbatim
             qˢ⁺¹ = qˢ + δt N(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹
  (2)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ =
         M(qˢ) vˢ + δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(qˢ,vˢ⁺¹)]
@endverbatim
(We are using s for step counter rather than n to avoid Unicode-induced
confusion with the "normal direction" subscript n.)

Please see details in the @ref one_way_coupling_derivation
"Derivation of the one-way coupling scheme" section.
The equation for the generalized velocities in Eq. (2) is rewritten as:
@verbatim
  (3)  M vˢ⁺¹ = p* + δt [Jₙᵀ fₙ + Jₜᵀ fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)]
@endverbatim
where `p* = M vˢ + δt τˢ` is the generalized momentum that the
system would have in the absence of contact forces and, for simplicity, we
have only kept the functional dependencies in generalized velocities. Notice
that %TamsiSolver uses a precomputed value of the normal forces.
These normal forces could be available for instance if
using a compliant contact approach, for which normal forces are a function
of the state.

@anchor two_way_coupling_scheme
<h2>Two-Way Coupling Scheme</h2>

Equation (1) is discretized in time using a variation on the
semi-implicit Euler scheme with time step `δt` as:
@verbatim
             qˢ⁺¹ = qˢ + δt N(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹
  (4)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
          δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙˢ⁺¹ + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(fₙˢ⁺¹,vₜˢ⁺¹)]
@endverbatim
This implicit scheme variation evaluates Jacobian matrices Jₙ and Jₜ as
well as the kinematic mapping N(q) at the previous time step. In Eq. (4) we
have fₙˢ⁺¹ = fₙ(xˢ⁺¹, vₙˢ⁺¹) with xˢ⁺¹ = x(qˢ⁺¹), the signed _penetration_
distance (defined positive when bodies overlap) between contact point pairs
and the _separation_ velocities vₙˢ⁺¹ = Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ (= −ẋˢ⁺¹). Also the
functional dependence of fₜ with fₙ and vₜ is highlighted in Eq. (4). More
precisely, the two-way coupling scheme uses a normal force law for each contact
pair of the form:
@verbatim
  (5)  fₙ(x, vₙ) = k(vₙ)₊ x₊
  (6)      k(vₙ) = k (1 − d vₙ)₊
@endverbatim
where `x₊` is the positive part of x (x₊ = x if x ≥ 0 and x₊ = 0 otherwise)
and `k` and d are the stiffness and dissipation coefficients for a given contact
point, respectively.

The two-way coupling scheme uses a first order approximation to the signed
distance functions vector:
@verbatim
  (7)  xˢ⁺¹ ≈ xˢ − δt vₙˢ⁺¹ =  xˢ − δt Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹
@endverbatim
where the minus sign is needed given that ẋ = dx/dt = −vₙ.
This approximation is used in Eq. (5) to obtain a numerical scheme that
implicitly couples normal forces through their functional dependence on the
signed penetration distance. Notice that, according to Eq. (5), normal forces
at each contact point are decoupled from each other. However their values are
coupled given the choice of a common variable, the generalized velocity v.

Equation (7) is used into Eq. (5) to obtain an expression of the normal
force in terms of the generalized velocity vˢ⁺¹ at the next time step:
@verbatim
  (8) fₙ(xˢ⁺¹, vₙˢ⁺¹) = k (1 − d vₙˢ⁺¹)₊ xˢ⁺¹₊
                      = k (1 − d Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹)₊ (xˢ − δt Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹)₊
                      = fₙ(vˢ⁺¹)
@endverbatim
Similarly, the friction forces fₜ can be written in terms of the next time
step generalized velocities using vₜˢ⁺¹ = Jₜ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ and using Eq. (8)
to substitute an expression for the normal force in terms of vˢ⁺¹. This
allows to re-write the tangential forces as a function of the generalized
velocities as:
@verbatim
  (9)  fₜ(fₙˢ⁺¹, vₜˢ⁺¹) = fₜ(fₙ(x(vˢ⁺¹), vₙ(vˢ⁺¹)), vₜ((vˢ⁺¹)))
                        = fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)
@endverbatim
where we write x(vˢ⁺¹) = xˢ − δt Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹.
Finally, Eqs. (8) and (9) are used into Eq. (4) to obtain an expression in
vˢ⁺¹:
@verbatim
  (10)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = p* + δt [Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(vˢ⁺¹) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)]
@endverbatim
with p* = `p* = M vˢ + δt τˢ` the generalized momentum that the system
would have in the absence of contact forces.

%TamsiSolver uses a Newton-Raphson strategy to solve Eq. (10) in
the generalized velocities, limiting the iteration update with the scheme
described in @ref iteration_limiter.

@anchor iteration_limiter
<h2>Limits in the Iteration Updates</h2>

%TamsiSolver solves for the generalized velocity at the next time
step `vˢ⁺¹` with either a one-way or two-way coupled scheme as described in the
 previous sections.
The solver uses a Newton-Raphson iteration to compute an update `Δvᵏ` at the
k-th Newton-Raphson iteration. Once `Δvᵏ` is computed, the solver limits the
change in the tangential velocities `Δvₜᵏ = Jₜᵀ Δvᵏ` using the approach
described in @ref uchida_etal_2015 "[Uchida et al., 2015]". This approach limits
the maximum angle change θ between two successive iterations in the tangential
velocity. Details of our implementation are provided in
@ref castro_etal_2019 "[Castro et al., 2019]".

@anchor one_way_coupling_derivation
<h2>Derivation of the one-way coupling scheme</h2>
In this section we provide a detailed derivation of the first order time
stepping approach in Eq. (2). We start from the continuous Eq. (1):
@verbatim
  (1)  M(q) v̇ = τ + Jₙᵀ(q) fₙ(q,v) + Jₜᵀ(q) fₜ(q,v)
@endverbatim
we can discretize Eq. (1) in time using a first order semi-implicit Euler
scheme in velocities:
@verbatim
  (11)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
          δt [τˢ⁺¹ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(qˢ,vˢ⁺¹) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)] + O₁(δt²)
@endverbatim
where the equality holds strictly since we included the leading terms in
`O(δt²)`. We use `τˢ⁺¹ = τ(tˢ, qˢ, vˢ⁺¹)` for brevity in Eq. (11).
When moving from the continuous Eq. (1) to the discrete version Eq. (11), we
lost the nice property that our compliant normal forces are decoupled from
the friction forces (both depend on the same unknown vˢ⁺¹ in Eq (11)). The
reason is that Eq. (11) includes an integration over a small interval of
size δt. To solve the discrete system in Eq. (11), we'd like to decouple the
normal forces from the tangential forces again, which will require a new
(though still valid) approximation.
To do so we will expand in Taylor series the term `fₙ(qˢ, vˢ⁺¹)`:
@verbatim
  (12)  fₙ(qˢ, vˢ⁺¹) = fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + ∇ᵥfₙ(qˢ,vˢ) (vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ) + O₂(‖vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ‖²)
@endverbatim
The difference between `vˢ` and `vˢ⁺¹` can be written as:
@verbatim
  (13)  vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ = δtv̇ˢ + δtO₃(δt²) = O₄(δt)
@endverbatim
Substituting `vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ` from Eq. (13) into Eq. (12) we arrive to:
@verbatim
  (14)  fₙ(qˢ, vˢ⁺¹) = fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + ∇ᵥfₙ(qˢ,vˢ) O₄(δt) + O₅(δt²)
                    = fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + O₆(δt)
@endverbatim
where `O₅(δt²) = O₂(‖vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ‖²) = O₂(‖O₄(δt)‖²)`. A similar argument for
τˢ⁺¹ shows it also differs in O(δt) from τˢ = τ(tˢ, qˢ, vˢ).
We can now use Eq. (14) into Eq. (11) to arrive to:
@verbatim
  (15)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
        δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) (fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + O₆(δt)] + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)) +
        O₁(δt²)
@endverbatim
which we can rewrite as:
@verbatim
  (16)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
      δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(qˢ, vˢ) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)] + O₇(δt²)
@endverbatim
with `O₇(δt²) = δt Jₙᵀ(qˢ) O₆(δt) + O₁(δt²)`.
That is, Eq. (16) introduces the same order of approximation as in the
semi-implicit method in Eq. (11).
Up to this point we have made no approximations but we instead propagated
the `O(⋅)` leading terms. Therefore the equalities in the equations above
are exact. To obtain an approximate time stepping scheme, we drop `O₇(δt²)`
(we neglect it) in Eq. (16) to arrive to a first order scheme:
@verbatim
  (17)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
                     δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)]
@endverbatim
Therefore, with the scheme in Eq. (17) we are able to decouple the
computation of (compliant) normal forces from that of friction forces.
A very important feature of this scheme however, is the explicit nature (in
the velocities v) of the term associated with the normal forces (usually
including dissipation in the normal direction), which will become unstable
for a sufficiently large time step. However, for most applications in
practice, the stability of the scheme is mostly determined by the explicit
update of normal forces with positions, that is, Eq. (17) is explicit in
positions through the normal forces `fₙ(qˢ, vˢ)`. For many common
applications, the explicit dependence of `τˢ(tˢ, qˢ, vˢ)` on the
previous time step velocities `vˢ` determines the overall stability of
the scheme, since this term can include velocity dependent contributions
such as control forces and dampers. Notice that Eq. (12) introduces an
expansion of `fₙ` with an order of approximation consistent with the
first order scheme as needed. Therefore, it propagates into a `O(δt²)`
term exactly as needed in Eq. (16).
