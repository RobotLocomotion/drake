/** Generates a tetrahedral volume mesh of a given box by subdividing the box
 into _rectangular cells_ (volume bounded by six axis-aligned faces) and
 subdividing each rectangular cell into five tetrahedra. Two adjacent
rectangular cells (sharing a rectangular face) are subdivided in the patterns
that are mirrored of each other so that the mesh is conforming.

The following picture file shows example of the diamond cubic box volume mesh
and demonstrates the mirrored subdivision pattern in adjacent cells. The file is
distributed with the source code.

   subdivision patterns to make sure the mesh is conforming.         |

 The output mesh will have these properties:

   1. The generated vertices are unique. There is no repeating vertices in
      the list of vertex coordinates.
   2. The generated tetrahedra are _conforming_. Two tetrahedra intersect in
      their shared face, or shared edge, or shared vertex, or not at all.
      There is no partial overlapping of two tetrahedra.
 @param[in] box
     The box shape specification (see drake::geometry::Box).
 @param[in] resolution_hint
     A measure (in meters) that controls the resolution of the mesh. The length
     of the axis-aligned edges of the mesh will be less than or equal to this
     parameter. The length of non-axis-aligned edges will be less than or equal
     to âˆš3 of this parameter. The coarsest possible mesh can be made by
     providing a resolution hint at least as large as the box's largest
     dimension.
 @param[in] X_WB
     The pose of the rectanglur volume mesh in the world frame.
