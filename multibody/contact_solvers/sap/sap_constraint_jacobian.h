/* Class to abstract the specific structure of Jacobian matrices for SAP
 constraints.

 In general, the constraint velocity vc is given as vc = J⋅v = ∑ᵢ₌₁ᴺJᵢ⋅vᵢ where
 vᵢ is the subvector in the vector of generalized velocities for the i-th clique
 (the ordering of the cliques is arbitrary) and Jᵢ is the non-zero block of the
 full constraint Jacobian J that correspond to contributions from the i-th
 clique. A constraint can only involve a single clique or two cliques, so N = 1
 or 2.

 This class exploits the sparsity in the constraint Jacobian by only storing the
 (at most 2) nonzero Jacobian blocks (as MatrixBlock). Further sparsity
 structure may exist within a single Jacobian block. See MatrixBlock for
 details.

 Therefore, the Jacobian matrix for a SAP constraint encodes sparsity at two
 levels:
  1. Per clique: This class stores a matrix (a MatrixBlock) per each clique that
     participates in the constraint. As explained above, only up to two cliques
     can participate in a given constraint.
  2. Within the clique: The MatrixBlock for a given clique might in turn have
     its own sparsity structure within the clique. See MatrixBlock for details.
