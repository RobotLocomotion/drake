/* In the SAP formulation of contact the state of a mechanical system is
advanced from the previous state x₀ = [q₀,v₀] to the next state x = [q,v]. The
SAP formulation linearizes the discrete time dynamics of the mechanical system
of interest to obtain the SAP momentum equations:
  A(v*)⋅(v−v*) = J(q₀)ᵀ⋅γ                                                   (1)
where v denotes the generalized velocities of the system, of size nv. Matrix A
(of size nv x nv) is a symmetric positive definite (SPD) approximation of the
linearized discrete dynamics, v* (of size nv) are the free-motion generalized
velocities (i.e. the velocities of the system when constraint impulses are
zero), γ (of size nk) are the constraint impulses and J (of size nk x nv) the
constraint Jacobian. SAP's formulation solves a strictly convex optimization
problem such that at optimality:
  1. the linearized momentum equation in Eq. (1) is satisfied and,
  2. impulses γ are constrained to live in a convex set.
Please refer to [Castro et al., 2021] for details.

Therefore a SapContactProblem is described by:
  1. The linear dynamics matrix A,
  2. the free motion velocities v* and,
  3. the set of constraints for the problem (which defines the Jacobian J).

Often times matrix A is block diagonal. This block diagonal structure of A
induces a partition of the nv generalized velocities. A subset in this partition
is referred to as a "clique". The total number of cliques in this partition
equals the number of diagonal blocks in A.
