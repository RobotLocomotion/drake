/* Implements contact constraints for the SAP solver.
 Here we provide a brief description of the contact forces modeled by this
 constraint, enough to introduce notation and the constraint's parameters.
 Please refer to [Castro et al., 2021] for an in-depth discussion.

 Normal Compliance:
  Contact constraints in the SAP formulation model a compliant normal impulse γₙ
  according to:
    γₙ/δt = (−k⋅ϕ−d⋅vₙ)₊
  where δt is the time step used in the formulation, k is the contact stiffness
  (in N/m), d is the dissipation (in N⋅s/m) and (x)₊ = max(0, x). ϕ and vₙ are
  the next time step values of the signed distance function and normal velocity
  respectively. ϕ is defined to be negative when bodies overlap and positive
  otherwise. vₙ is defined to be positive when bodies move away from each other
  and negative when they move towards each other. Dissipation is parameterized
  as d = tau_d⋅k, where tau_d is the "dissipation time scale".

 Regularized Friction:
  SAP contact constraints regularize friction. That is, in stiction the
  tangential contact impulses obeys:
    γₜ = −vₜ/Rₜ
  where vₜ is the tangential velocity and Rₜ is the regularization parameter for
  the tangential direction.
  During sliding, the friction impulse obeys:
    γₜ = −μγₙt̂
  where t̂ = vₜ/‖vₜ‖.
  Notice that:
    1. The friction impulse always opposes the tangential velocity, satisfying
       the principle of maximum dissipation.
    2. It obeys Coulomb's law of friction, i.e. ‖γₜ‖ ≤ μγₙ.

  Regularization of friction means that during stiction there might be a
  residual non-zero slip velocity, even if small and negligible for a particular
  application. [Castro et al., 2021] estimate this slip velocity vₛ to be in the
  order of vₛ ≈ σ⋅δt⋅g, where g is the acceleration of gravity (≈9.81m/s² on
  planet Earth) and σ is a dimensionless parameter used to parameterize the
  regularization introduced by the constraint in a scale independent manner.
  Typical values reside in the range σ ∈ (10⁻⁴,10⁻²).

 The contact velocity vc = [vₜ, vₙ] ∈ ℝ³ for this constraint is defined such
 that:
   vc = J⋅v
 where J is the constraint's Jacobian and v is the vector of generalized
 velocities for the cliques involved in the constraint.
