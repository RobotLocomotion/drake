/* This class serves to represent constraints supported by the SapSolver as
described in [Castro et al., 2021].

All SAP constraints are described by a convex cost function ℓ(vc), where vc is
the constraint velocity. The constraint velocity (along with sign conventions
used by specific constraints) is defined at construction given the constraint
Jacobian J such that vc = J⋅v, where v are the generalized velocities of the
SapContactProblem. The size of vc defines a fixed number nₑ of constraint
equations, see num_constraint_equations() (E.g. 3 for contact constraints, 1 for
a distance constraint).

In this formulation, constraint impulses are simply defined by:
  γ(vc) = −∂ℓ/∂vc
where γ is also a vector of size nₑ. The Hessian of the constraint is then
given by:
  G(vc) = −∂γ/∂vc = ∂²ℓ/∂vc²
of size nₑ×nₑ, it is positive semi-definite given the cost function ℓ(vc) is
convex.

Specific constraint types will provide a definition for ℓ(vc), γ(vc) and G(vc)
with the implementation of DoCalcCost(), DoCalcImpulse(), and DoCalcHessian(),
respectively.

  /* @name Physical forces
   @anchor sap_physical_forces
   Each SAP constraint leads to a set of impulses in the solution of their
   corresponding SapContactProblem. These impulses map to physical generalized
   and/or spatial forces on the physical objects being constrained. As an
   example, a distance constraint leads to a single scalar impulse value,
   however the actual physical forces are vectors that act along the direction
   of the two points being constrained. These forces are applied on the objects
   being constrained, e.g. a rigid body, deformable body or particle. It is the
   specific constraint type that knows how to map these impulses to physical
   generalized and/or spatial forces. In the constraints framework to report
   forces, client code (in Drake, most likely the SapDriver) will label these
   physical objects with indices, arbitrarily defined to uniquely identify
   distinct physical objects. With these labels defined, the constraint will be
   able to report physical forces (or rather impulses) on these objects via
   AccumulateSpatialImpulses().

   Specific constraint types might require these object indices at construction
   (e.g. the contact contraint between two objects). Object indices, if any, are
   provided at construction. Refer to this class's constructor for details.

   Generalized impulses are reported on a per-clique basis via
