/* This class serves to represent constraints supported by the SapSolver as
described in [Castro et al., 2021].

All SAP constraints are compliant. That is, SAP does not impose the hard
constraint g(q, v, t) = 0 but rather applies a compliant force that drives the
state towards g(q, v, t) = 0. More specifically, the impulse γ applied by a
constraint in the SAP formulation admits the analytical form:
  γ/δt = P(−k⋅g−cġ)                                                         (1)
where δt is the discrete time step used in the formulation, k is the
constraint's stiffness, c is its linear dissipation and P is a projection
operator. For instance, for contact constraints, P projects the compliant
impulse y = −k⋅g−cġ onto the friction cone, see the documentation of
SapConstraint::Project() for details. We parameterize the linear dissipation c
in terms of a "dissipation time scale" τ (in seconds) as c=τ⋅k.

A particular constraint defines a fixed number nᵢ of constraint equations, see
num_constraint_equations() (E.g. 3 for contact constraints, 1 for a distance
constraint). Then γ, g, ġ in Eq. (1) are all vectors of size nᵢ and stiffness k
and damping c are positive diagonal matrices of size nᵢ×nᵢ. Then the projection
P projects vectors in the real nᵢ-space into vectors in the same space. Refer to
Project()'s documentation for further details.

The constraint's Jacobian J is defined such that ġ = J⋅v + b where v are the
generalized velocities of the system and b is the bias term b = ∂g/∂t. When a
constraint is instantiated, constraint function g and Jacobian J are provided at
construction for the state of the mechanical system at the previous (current)
time step. Therefore an instance of this class is a function of the state of the
dynamical system.

In general a constraint will couple the degrees of freedom of two cliques
(please refer to SapContactProblem's documentation for a definition of
cliques). Therefore ġ = J⋅v = J₁⋅v₁ + J₂⋅v₂ where v₁ and v₂ correspond to the
vector of generalized velocities for the first and second clique respectively
(which clique is designated as first or second is arbitrary). Similarly, J₁ and
J₂ are the non-zero blocks of the full Jacobian J that correspond to
contributions from the first and second cliques respectively. A constraint can
also involve only a single clique. Examples include a coupler constraint between
DOFs in a single clique or a contact constraint with the world (the world has no
DOFs and therefore has no clique.) For the case of a single clique constraint,
only one clique and a single block J₁ needs to be provided at construction. For
details, refer to the documentation for this class's constructors.

TODO(amcastro-tri): consider extension to support constraints among more than
two cliques, see issue #16575.
