/** The %DifferentialInverseKinematicsSystem takes as input desired cartesian
poses (or cartesian velocities) for an arbitrary number of "goal" frames on the
robot, and produces a generalized velocity command as output to move the goal
frames toward the desired state. This system is stateless, but is intended to be
clocked at a known, fixed time step Δt by evaluating its output port at integer
multiples of Δt.

The velocity command is computed by solving a MathematicalProgram optimization
problem, consisting of:
- one primary objective (LeastSquaresCost),
- typically a secondary objective (JointCenteringCost) to resolve the nullspace
  within the primary objective, and
- various optional constraints:
  - CartesianPositionLimitConstraint
  - CartesianVelocityLimitConstraint
  - CollisionConstraint
  - JointVelocityLimitConstraint

In brief, we solve for `v_next` such that `Jv_TGs * v_next` is close to `Vd_TGs`
subject to the constraints, where:
- v_next is the generalized velocity command on the output port, which has the
  dimension of the number of active degrees of freedom,
- Vd_TGs is the desired spatial velocities of the goal frames (when desired
  positions are input, the desired velocity is inferred using the difference
  from the current position vs the time step),
- Jv_TGs is the jacobian relating spatial velocities to generalized velocities,
  i.e., V_TGs (rows) with respect to v_active (cols) -- v_active is the subset
  of generalized velocities for the active degrees of freedom.

For an introduction to differential inverse kinematics via optimization,

@endsystem

Port `position` accepts the current generalized position (for the full `plant`,
not just the active dofs).

Port `desired_cartesian_velocities` accepts desired cartesian velocities, typed
as systems::BusValue where key is the name of the frame to track and the value
is the SpatialVelocity<double> w.r.t the task frame. Frame names should be
provided as fully-scoped names (`model_instance::frame`).

Port `desired_cartesian_poses` accepts desired cartesian poses, typed as
systems::BusValue where key is the name of the frame to track and the
value is the math::RigidTransformd spatial pose w.r.t the task frame.
Frame names should be provided as fully-scoped names (`model_instance::frame`).

Port `nominal_posture` accepts a generalized position to be used to handle
nullspace resolution; this has the dimension of the full degrees of freedom
(not just active dofs). Typical choices for setting this input would be to use a
constant "home" reference posture, or to use a dynamically changing recent
posture.

Port `commanded_velocity` emits generalized velocity that realizes the desired
cartesian velocities or poses within the constraints. This has the dimension of
the number of active degrees of freedom.

Either `desired_cartesian_velocities` or `desired_cartesian_poses` must be
connected. Connecting both ports will result in an exception.

@note There is no consistency check to ensure that the frames being tracked are
the same across multiple time steps.

@warning This class only works correctly when the plant has v = q̇.

= Notation =

The implementation uses "monogram notation" abbreviations throughout. See
https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__quantities.html for
details. The relevant frame names are:
- B: base frame
- Gi: the i'th goal frame (per the desired_cartesian_... input port)
- T: task frame
- W: world frame

To denote desired spatial velocities, we use a "d" suffix (i.e., "Vd").
Quantities like Vd_TGi (and therefore also Vd_TGlist and Vd_TGs) refer to the
desired velocity, not the current velocity. Other quantities without the "d"
subscript (e.g., X_TGi, Jv_TGi, etc.) refer to the current kinematics.

When 's' is used as a suffix (e.g., 'Vd_TGs'), it refers to the stack of all
goals one after another, e.g., Vd_TGs refers to the concatenation of all Vd_TGi
in Vd_TGlist. You can think of the 's' either as an abbreviation for "stack" or
as a plural.

We also use the letter 'S' to refer a "multibody system", in our case the robot
portion of the controller plant (not including the environment), as defined by
the collision_checker. For example, use the notation 'Scm' to denote the robot's
center of mass.

    input to velocities. The i'th desired cartesian velocity is computed as:
      `Vd_TGi = K_VX * (X_TGi_requested - X_TGi_current) / Δt`
    A typical value is 1.0 so that the desired velocity exactly matches what's
    necessary to move to the request pose in the next step, but may be tuned
    smaller (e.g., 0.5) to mitigate overshoot. This value is not used when the
    `desired_cartesian_velocities` input port is being used for commands.
  @param Vd_TG_limit A clamping limit applied to desired cartesian velocities.
    All desired cartesian velocities (whether specified explicitly on the
    `desired_cartesian_velocities` input port, or inferred from the
    `desired_cartesian_poses` input port) are "clamped"; the absolute value of
    each measure in the clamped spatial velocity will be no greater than the
    corresponding measure in Vd_TG_limit. This _clamped_ velocity becomes the
    input to the optimization problem. (NOTE: Clamping for
    `desired_cartesian_velocities` is not yet implemented, but will be soon.)
    If the CartesianVelocityLimitConstraint is in use, typically this value
    should be the same as that ingredient's V_next_TG_limit. */

/** Provides a secondary minimization objective. There will almost inevitably be
times when the jacobian `Jv_TGs` is not full rank. Sometimes because of current
position values and sometimes because `Jv_TGs` is rectangular by construction.
At those times, there's no longer a single solution and relying on the
mathematical program to pick a reasonable solution from the large space is
unreasonable.

This cost is intended to work in conjunction with the primary cost (e.g.,
LeastSquaresCost). When `Jv_TGs` is not full rank, this provides guidance for
selecting a _unique_ velocity from the space of possible solutions. If the
primary cost produces a space of optimal velocities, this secondary cost will
select the velocity from that space that brings the arm closer to the "nominal
posture":

   |P⋅(v_next - K⋅(nominal_posture_active - q_active))|²

where,
- `K` is the proportional gain of a joint-space controller that pulls toward the
  nominal posture.
- `P` is the linear map from generalized velocities to the _null space_ of
  masked Jacobian `S ⋅ Jv_TGs`. Mapping to the null space, allows refinement of
  the velocity without changing the primary cost.
- S is a block-diagonal matrix of axis masks, enabling per-axis tracking.

Notes:
- When combined with a primary cost, the primary cost should be weighed far more
  heavily to keep this secondary cost from interfering. A factor of 100X or so
  is advisable. (See LeastSqauresCost::cartesian_qp_weight for tuning the gain
  on the primary objective.)
- For this cost to behave as expected, it is critical that the null space of
  `S ⋅ Jv_TGs` be a subspace of the null space used by the primary cost. The
  simplest way is to make sure both costs receive the same axis masks and
  jacobian. Failure to do so would lead this cost to _fight_ the primary cost
  instead of complementing it.

For more details on this cost, see:
https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/pick.html#diff_ik_w_constraints#joint_centering

/** Constrains the generalized velocity to prevent a commanded velocity that
would push the generalized position outside its limits.

The configured joint velocity limits are not used directly. When the joint
position is near a limit, the joint velocity limit may be insufficient to
constrain `v_next` from pushing the position beyond its limits.

Instead, we use a _scaled_ velocity limit. In simple terms, the closer `q` is to
its position limit, the more velocity towards that limit is constrained. When
`q` lies at the limit boundary, the velocity in that direction would be zero.
However, the configured velocity limit should be applied when q is
"sufficiently" far away from the position limit boundary. So, we compute and
apply a scale factor to attenuate the "near" velocity limit.

The constraint is parameterized to define the domain of the attenuation; how far
away from the near limit boundary should the scaled limit be zero and how far
should it be restored to its configured value? We parameterize those two
distances as:

  - `min_margin`: the distance at which the velocity limit is scaled to be zero.
                  Must be non-negative and is typically positive.
  - `influence_margin`: the distance at which the velocity limit is
                        restored to its configured value. This value must be
                        strictly greater than `min_margin`.

The velocity limit is only ever attenuated on one boundary.

If we define `distᵢ` as the distance to the near position limit boundary, and
`near_limit` as the value of that limit, we can define the attenuation as:

```
  distᵢ = min(qᵢ_current - qᵢ_min, qᵢ_max - qᵢ_current)
  scale = clamp((distᵢ - min_margin) / (influence_margin - min_margin), 0, 1)
  scaled_near_limit = near_limit * scale.
```

Implications:
 - Because we're _attenuating_ the configured velocity limits, an infinite limit
   value won't be attenuated. It _will_ be zero when `distᵢ ≤ min_margin`.
 - Position limits define an interval for q, which we'll call P. If
   `P / 2 - min_margin < influence_margin - min_margin` then one limit will
   _always_ be attenuated to be less than its configured value. */
