/** For certain robots (whose joint transforms are algebraic functions of joint
 variables, for example revolute/prismatic/floating-base joints), we can
 represent the pose (position, orientation) of each body, as rational
 functions, namely n(s) / d(s) where both the numerator n(s) and denominator
 d(s) are polynomials of s, and s is some variable related to the generalized
 position.

 One example is that for a rotation matrix with angle θ and axis a, the
 rotation matrix can be written as I + sinθ A + (1-cosθ) A², where A is the
 skew-symmetric matrix from axis a. We can use the stereographic projection to
 substitute the trigonometric function sinθ and cosθ as
 cosθ = cos(θ*+Δθ) = cos(θ*)•cos(Δθ) - sin(θ*)•sin(Δθ)
      = (1-s²)/(1+s²) cos(θ*)- 2s/(1+s²) sin(θ*)     (1)
 sinθ = sin(θ*+Δθ) = sin(θ*)•cos(Δθ) - cos(θ*)•sin(Δθ)
      = (1-s²)/(1+s²) sin(θ*)- 2s/(1+s²) cos(θ*)     (2)
 where θ* is the angle around which we take the stereographic projection.
 θ = θ*+Δθ, and s = tan(Δθ/2).
 With (1) and (2), both sinθ and cosθ are written as a rational function of s.
 Thus the rotation matrix can be written as rational functions of s.

 We will use q* to denote the nominal posture. For a revolute joint, the
 q* is the variable θ*. Note that the stereographic projection has a
 singularity at θ = θ* ± π, as s = tan(Δθ/2)=tan(±π/2) is ±infinity.

 For prismatic joint, we define s = d - d*, where d is the displacement of the
 joint, and d* is the joint value in q*.

 Currently we only support robots with revolute, prismatic and weld joints.

 Throughout this file, we use the following convention
 1. q denotes the generalized position of the entire robot. It includes the
 angle of a revolute joint, the displacement of a prismatic joint, etc.
 2. θ denotes the revolute joint angle.
 3. t=tan((θ-θ*)/2)
 4. s is the vector of variables, such that the robot body pose is written as
 an algebraic function (rational function) of s.

  We will first compute the body pose as multilinear polynomials, with

  The reason why we don't use RationalFunction directly, is that currently

  namely the sum between rational functions p1(x) / (q1(x) * r(x)) + p2(x) /
  r(x) is computed as (p1(x) * r(x) + p2(x) * q1(x) * r(x)) / (q1(x) * r(x) *

   We explain the terminology on `parent` and `child`, which is different
   from that in MultibodyTreeTopology. If we designate a certain body as the
   root body, then between two adjacent bodies, the one closer to this root
   body is the parent, the one farther from the root body is the child.
   MultibodyTreeTopology usually designates the world as the root body, but we
   don't follow this convention here, and we regard the body attached with the
   expressed frame A as the root body, hence the parent/child relationship
   might be flipped from that defined in MultibodyTreeTopology.
   This convention is used to be consistent with the motivating paper "Finding
   and Optimizing Certified, Collision-Free Regions in Configuration Space for
   Robot Manipulators", where we often need to compute the pose of the world
   body expressed in a robot body (rather than computing the pose of a robot
