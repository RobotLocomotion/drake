// TODO(xuchenhan-tri): Provide some details on spatial integration orders.
/** %FemModel calculates the components of the spatially discretized FEM
 equations for dynamic elasticity problems. Typically, in dynamic elasticity
 problems, we are interested in the mapping that describes the motion of a
 material

     ϕ(⋅,t) : Ω⁰ → Ωᵗ,

 where Ω⁰ and Ωᵗ are subsets of R³, along with its first and second derivatives
 (velocity and acceleration respectively):

     V(⋅,t) = ∂ϕ(⋅,t)/∂t,
     A(⋅,t) = ∂²ϕ(⋅,t)/∂t².

 We call Ω⁰ the reference domain and Ωᵗ the current domain. We use upper case
 letters to denote states (positions, velocities, and accelerations) in
 reference domain (X, V, A) and lower case letters to denote their current
 domain counterparts (x, v, a). In particular, x(X,t) = ϕ(X,t). The deformation
 gradient F(X,t) is given by ∂ϕ(X,t)/∂X.

 The governing equations of interest are conservation of mass and conservation
 of momentum:

     R(X,t)J(X,t) = R(X,0),
     R(X,0)A(X,t) = fᵢₙₜ(X,t) + fₑₓₜ(X,t),

 where R is mass density, fᵢₙₜ and fₑₓₜ are internal and external force
 densities respectively, and J is the determinant of the deformation gradient.
 Using finite element method to discretize in space, one gets

     ϕ(X,t) = ∑ᵢ xᵢ(t)Nᵢ(X)
     V(X,t) = ∑ᵢ vᵢ(t)Nᵢ(X)
     A(X,t) = ∑ᵢ aᵢ(t)Nᵢ(X)

 where xᵢ, vᵢ, aᵢ ∈ R³ are nodal values of the spatially discretized position,
 velocity and acceleration, and Nᵢ(X):Ω⁰ → R are the the basis functions. With
 this spatial discretization, the PDE is turned into an ODE of the form

     G(x, v, a) = 0,            (1)

 where x, v, a are the stacked xᵢ, vᵢ, aᵢ. %FemModel provides methods to
 query various information about equation (1) and its derivatives given an FEM
 state (x, v, a).

 We implement %FemModel in FemModelImpl that templatizes on the type of
 FemElement. Many functionalities provided by %FemModel (e.g.
 CalcTangentMatrix()) involve evaluating computationally intensive loops
 over FEM elements, and the overhead caused by virtual methods may be
 significant. We implement those functions in FemModelImpl templated on the
 FemElement to avoid the overhead of virtual methods. The type information at
 compile time also helps eliminate heap allocations.
