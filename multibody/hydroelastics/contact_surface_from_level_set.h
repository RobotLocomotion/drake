// Marching tetrahedra table. Each entry in this table has an index value

// binary so that a "1" corresponds to a positive value at that vertex and
// conversely "0" corresponds to a negative value. The least significant bit,
// bit 0, maps to vertex 0 while the most significant bit, bit 3, maps to
// vertex 3. Each entry stores a vector of edges. Based on the sign of the level
// set, these edges are the ones with a zero level set crossing. Edges are
// numbered according to table kEdges. The edges have been ordered such that a
// polygon formed by the intersection vertices visited in the same order has a
// right-handed normal pointing in the direction of increasing "phi", and it can
// be shown (through a lot of algebra) that the polygon is always planar (even
// for arbitrary level set functions and a polygon with four sides). See Figure
// 3 in [Bloomenthal, 1994] cited in the documentation for
// CalcZeroLevelSetInMeshDomain() for details on the entries in this table. We
// changed the order of the edges here so that they always form a closed

// Given a tetrahedron defined by the four vertices in `tet_vertices_N` and
// a corresponding set of level set values at each vertex in `phi`, this
// method computes a continuous triangulation of the zero level set surface
// within the domain of the tetrahedron. With "continuous" we mean that small
// perturbations to `phi` will not induce changes on the topology of the
// triangulation. To be more precise, as the phi changes continuously the
// topology remains fixed with the triangles themselves changing continuously.
// When topoology changes (adding or removing triangles), the disappearing
// triangle's area has first continuously gone to zero (and, conversely, the
// newly added triangle's area has continuously increased from zero). The
// positions of the input vertices `tet_vertices_N` are measured and expressed
// in a frame N. On return this method adds the new vertices and faces of the
// triangulation into `vertices_N` and `faces`, respectively and returns the
// number of vertices added. The geometric interpretation of the tetrahedron is
// described in the documentation for the parameter `tet_vertices_N`. Finally,
// the input scalar field `e_m` evaluated at each vertex of the tetrahedron is
// linearly interpolated for each new vertex in `vertices_N` and placed in
// `e_m_surface`.
//
// @param[in] tet_vertices_N
//   Vertices defining the tetrahedron. The first three vertices define the
//   first face of the tetrahedra, with its right-handed normal pointing towards
//   the outside. The last vertex is on the "negative side" of the first face.
// @param[in] phi
//   The level set function evaluated at each of the four vertices in
//   `tet_vertices_N`, in the same order.
// @param[in] e_m
//   A discrete, linear representation of a scalar field, defined by the value
//   of the field at the tetrahedron vertices.
// @param[out] vertices_N
//   Adds the new vertices into `vertices`.
// @param[out] faces
//   Adds the new faces into `faces`.
// @param[out] e_m_surface
//   The scalar field `e_m` linearly interpolated onto each new vertex in
//   `vertices`, in the same order.
// @returns The number of vertices added.
// @note The convention used by this private method is different from the
// one used in geometry::VolumeMesh. For this method, vertices must be
// provided in the order documented in the input parameter `tet_vertices_N`. For
