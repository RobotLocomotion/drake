A guide to using hydroelastic contact in practice.

@section hug_introduction Introduction

There are many ways to model contact between rigid bodies. Drake uses an
approach we call “compliant” contact. In compliant contact, nominally rigid
bodies are allowed to penetrate slightly, as if the rigid body had a slightly
deformable layer, but whose compression has no appreciable effect on the body’s
mass properties. The contact force between two deformed bodies is distributed
over a contact patch with an uneven pressure distribution over that patch. It
is common in robotics to model that as a single point contact or a set of point
contacts. Hydroelastic contact instead attempts to approximate the patch and
pressure distribution to provide much richer and more realistic contact
behavior. For a high-level overview, see [this blog post]
(https://medium.com/toyotaresearch/rethinking-contact-simulation-for-robot-manipulation-434a56b5ec88).

Drake implements two models for resolving contact to forces: point contact and
hydroelastic contact. See @ref compliant_contact for a fuller discussion of the
theory and practice of contact models. For notes on implementation status, see
@ref hydro_appendix_a. Also see @ref hydro_appendix_examples_and_tutorials.

@subsection hug_quick_hydro Hydroelastic Quick-start

The @ref drake::geometry::DefaultProximityProperties
"proximity default configuration settings" of SceneGraph offer a quick-start
path to using hydroelastic contact without the need to fully annotate the
collision geometries of robot models. (The full annotation process is described
in @ref creating_hydro_reps.)

While it is unlikely that the homogeneous parameters set by automatic
hydroelastic configuration will be sufficient to model diverse sets of
collision geometries, it may be a good starting point for some. It allows an
incremental approach to adding hydroelastic annotations as needed.

To get very simple and quick hydroelastic configuration, all that is needed is
to set the configuration for drake::geometry::SceneGraph:

@code
  geometry::SceneGraphConfig scene_graph_config;
  scene_graph_config.default_proximity_properties.compliance_type = "compliant";
  auto [plant, scene_graph] =
      multibody::AddMultibodyPlant(plant_config, scene_graph_config, &builder);
@endcode

For an example of a trivial conversion of an existing simulation, see the <a
href="https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/examples/simple_gripper">examples/simple_gripper</a>
program in the Drake source code. It offers a `--default_compliance_type`
command line option, which permits trying various compliance types.

All of the geometries in contexts created for the scene graph will be annotated
with a default set of proximity properties.

These transformations will allow hydroelastic contact to work, but the values
of the properties may not be ideal. The default set of properties are
controlled by drake::geometry::DefaultProximityProperties. They can be changed
for each application.

Having used scene graph configuration proximity defaults to get up and running,
it may still be useful to add specific hydroelastic annotations to model
files. Any explicit properties in model files (or applied by calling Drake
APIs) will take precedence over the default proximity properties for the
annotated geometries.

@section hug_working_with_hydro Working with Hydroelastic Contact

It is relatively simple to enable a simulation to use hydroelastic
contact. However, using it effectively requires some experience and
consideration. This section details the mechanisms and choices involved in
enabling hydroelastic contact and the next section helps guide you through some
common tips, tricks, and traps.

Using hydroelastic contact requires two things:
- Configuring the system (drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant) to use hydroelastic
  contact.
- Applying appropriate properties to the collision geometries to enable
  hydroelastic contact calculations.

Collision geometries for hydroelastic contact can be either
"compliant-hydroelastic" with tetrahedral meshes describing an
internal pressure field or "rigid-hydroelastic" with triangle
surface meshes that are regarded as infinitely stiff.
The figure below shows examples of a compliant hydroelastic box
and a rigid hydroelastic box.

The figure below shows a contact surface between a compliant-hydroelastic cylinder
and a compliant-hydroelastic sphere. The contact surface is internal to both
solids and is defined as the surface where the two pressure fields are equal.

@subsection hug_enabling Enabling Hydroelastic contact in your simulation

Because @ref drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant "MultibodyPlant"
is responsible for computing the dynamics of the
system (and the contact forces are part of that), the ability to enable/disable
the hydroelastic contact model is part of `MultibodyPlant`’s API:
drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant::set_contact_model().

There are three different options:
- drake::multibody::ContactModel::kPoint
- drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelastic
- drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelasticWithFallback

The default model is
@ref drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelasticWithFallback
"kHydroelasticWithFallback".

@ref drake::multibody::ContactModel::kPoint "kPoint" is the implementation of
the point contact model (see @ref compliant_contact).

Models @ref drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelastic "kHydroelastic" and
@ref drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelasticWithFallback
"kHydroelasticWithFallback" will both enable the hydroelastic contact. For
forces to be created from hydroelastic contact, geometries need to have
hydroelastic representations (see @ref hug_quick_hydro,
@ref creating_hydro_reps).

@ref drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelastic "kHydroelastic" is a strict
contact model that will attempt to create a hydroelastic contact surface
whenever a geometry with a hydroelastic representation appears to be in contact
(based on broad-phase bounding volume culling). With this contact model, the
simulator will throw an exception if:

- The contact is between two geometries with rigid hydroelastic representation,
or
- The contact is between a geometry with a hydroelastic representation and one
without.

Collisions between two geometries where neither has a hydroelastic
representation are simply ignored.

@ref drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelasticWithFallback
"kHydroelasticWithFallback" provides “fallback” behavior for when
@ref drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelastic "kHydroelastic" would throw.
When those scenarios are detected, it uses the point contact model between the
colliding geometries so that the contact can be accounted for and produce
contact forces. As the implementation evolves, more and more contact will be
captured with hydroelastic contact and the circumstances in which the
point-contact fallback is applied will decrease.

@subsection creating_hydro_reps Creating hydroelastic representations of collision geometries

There are three ways to configure hydroelastic representations for collision
geometries:
- by using drake::geometry::DefaultProximityProperties (see @ref hug_quick_hydro)
- by annotating model files (see @ref hug_file_specs)
- programmatically (see @ref hug_code_properties)

If none of the above are done, no geometry in drake::geometry::SceneGraph has a
hydroelastic representation. So, enabling hydroelastic contact in
`MultibodyPlant`, but forgetting to configure the geometries will lead to
either simulation crashes or point contact-based forces.

In order for a mesh to be given a hydroelastic representation, it must be
assigned certain properties. The exact properties it needs depends on the Shape
type and whether it is rigid or compliant. Some properties can be defined, but
if they are absent they’ll be provided by `MultibodyPlant`. First we’ll discuss
each of the properties and then discuss how they can be specified.

<!-- TODO(rpoyner-tri): consider restructuring this section to paragraphs,
     rather than a nested list -->
@subsubsection hug_properties Properties for hydroelastic contact
- Hydroelastic classification
   - To have a hydroelastic representation, a shape needs to be classified as
     either “compliant” or “rigid”. This must be explicit -- there are no
     implicit assumptions. Otherwise, it will participate in point contact only.
- Resolution hint (meters)
   - A positive real value in meters.
   - Most shapes (capsules, cylinders, ellipsoids, spheres) need to be
     tessellated into meshes. The resolution hint controls the fineness of the
     meshes.
   - For all tessellated geometries, Drake puts hard limits on the effect of
     the resolution hint property. There is a limit to how fine Drake will
     tessellate a primitive. Drake has hard-coded internal limits that are
     still very generous (approximately 100 million tetrahedra or triangles)
     which should be more than enough for any application. In practice,
     resolution hints will be quite “large” as coarser meshes are typically
     more desirable.
   - Notes on choosing a value:
     - Generally, the coarsest mesh that produces desirable results will allow
       the simulation to run as efficiently as possible.
       - The coarsest mesh will typically be generated when the resolution is
         equal to the geometry’s maximum measure (see the details below).
     - If tessellation artifacts become obvious in the simulation, either make
       the object more compliant (see hydroelastic modulus) or increase the
       resolution (as discussed for the various shapes below).
   - Geometric detail:
     - For each geometry type, the resolution hint works with some (maybe
       abstract) choice of a representative circle, and its effect is defined
       in terms of the circumference of that circle. The resolution hint is the
       target length of each edge of the tessellated mesh around the
       circle. The circle will have N = ⌈2πr/h⌉ edges, where r is the capsule
       radius and h is the resolution hint. The number N changes
       discontinuously as h changes. However, generally, decreasing the
       resolution hint by some factor will increase the number of edges by that
       same factor. The number of elements will grow quadratically.
       - Sphere
         - The representative circle is the great circle of the sphere.
       - Cylinder
         - The representative circle is the base of the cylinder.
       - Capsule
         - The representative circle is the base of the cylinder, which is also
           the great circle of each hemisphere.
       - Ellipsoid
         - The representative circle is an abstract circle whose radius is that
           of the largest semi-axis of the elllipsoid.
     - Resolution hint has no effect on Box.
- Hydroelastic modulus (Pa (N/m²))
  - This is the measure of how stiff the material is. It directly defines how
    much pressure is exerted given a certain amount of penetration. More
    pressure leads to greater forces. Larger values create stiffer objects. An
    infinite modulus is mathematically equivalent to a “rigid”
    object. (Although, it is definitely better, in that case, to simply declare
    it “rigid”.)
  - This is *only* required for shapes declared to be “compliant”. It can be
    defined for shapes declared as “rigid”, but the value will be ignored. (It
    can be convenient to always define it to enable tests where one might
    toggle the classification between rigid and compliant such that the
    compliant declaration is always well formed.)
  - Declaring a geometry to be compliant but not providing a valid hydroelastic
    modulus will produce an error at the time the geometry is added to
    `SceneGraph`.
  - This is similar to something like Young’s modulus but it is not identical.
    - The primary distinction is this isn’t purely a material property. The
      value is entangled with the geometry. It essentially scales the force
      based on the *percentage* of penetration into an object (i.e.,
      strain). So, a fixed modulus value might lead to a 1cm penetration on one
      sphere. But if the sphere were scaled up by a factor of 10, the
      penetration would become 10cm. So, if there are constraints on
      penetration depth, the modulus would have to increase with the scale of
      the geometry.
  - Notes on choosing a value:
    - Starting with the value for Young’s modulus is not
      unreasonable. Empirical evidence suggests that the hydroelastic modulus
      tends to be smaller depending on the size of the objects.
    - For large modulus values, the resolution of the representations matter
      more. A very high modulus will keep the contact near the surface of the
      geometry, exposing tessellation artifacts. A smaller modulus has a
      smoothing effect.
- Hunt-Crossley dissipation (s/m)
  - A non-negative real value.
  - This gives the contact an energy-damping property.
  - The larger the value, the more energy is damped.
  - If no value is provided, `MultibodyPlant` provides a default value of zero.
  - Notes on choosing a value:
    - For objects that are nominally rigid, starting with zero-damping is good.
    - If the behavior seems “jittery”, gradually increase the amount of
      dissipation. Typical values would remain in the range [0, 100] with 10 to
      50 being a typical damping amount.
    - The inverse of the Hunt-Crossley dissipation is the maximum bounce
      velocity between two objects. Therefore, if maximum bounce velocities of
      10 cm/s are acceptable, a dissipation of 10 s/m will keep bounce
      velocities bounded to this range.
    - Warning: values larger than about 500 s/m are unphysical and typically
      lead to numerical problems. Due to time discretization errors, the user
      will see objects that take a long time to go back to their rest state.
    - Remember, as this value increases, your simulation will lose energy at a
      higher rate.
  - See @ref mbp_dissipation_model "Modeling Dissipation" for details.
- Slab thickness
  - A positive real value in meters
  - Only used for compliant half spaces. Declaring a half space to be compliant
    but lacking a value for slab thickness will cause the simulation to error
    out.
  - A measure of the thickness of the compliant material near the boundary of
    the half space.
    - A compliant half space can be made more rigid by:
      - Increasing the hydroelastic modulus and fixing slab thickness.
      - Fixing the hydroelastic modulus and decreasing the slab thickness.
      - Increasing the hydroelastic modulus and decreasing the slab thickness.

@subsection hug_geometry_properties Assigning hydroelastic properties to geometries

Properties can be assigned to geometries inside a URDF or SDFormat file using
some custom Drake XML tags. Alternatively, the properties can be assigned
programmatically.

@subsubsection hug_file_specs Assigning hydroelastic properties in file specifications

Drake has introduced a number of custom tags to provide a uniform language to
specify hydroelastic properties in both URDF and SDFormat. The tag names are
the same but the values are expressed differently (to align with the practices
common to URDF and SDFormat). For example, consider a custom tag <drake:foo>
that takes a single integer value. In an SDFormat file it would look like:

    <drake:foo>17</drake:foo>

But in a URDF file it would look like this:

    <drake:foo value=”17”/>

Both URDF and SDFormat files define a <collision> tag. This tag contains the
tag for specifying the geometry type and associated properties. The
hydroelastic properties can be specified as a child of the <collision>
tag. Consider the following SDFormat example:

    …
      <collision name="body1_collision">
        <geometry>
          ...
        </geometry>
        <drake:proximity_properties>
          <drake:compliant_hydroelastic/>
          <drake:mesh_resolution_hint>0.1</drake:mesh_resolution_hint>
          <drake:hydroelastic_modulus>5e7</drake:hydroelastic_modulus>
          <drake:hunt_crossley_dissipation>1.25</drake:hunt_crossley_dissipation>
        </drake:proximity_properties>
      </collision>
    …
and the following equivalent URDF example:

    …
      <collision name="body1_collision">
        <geometry>
          ...
        </geometry>
        <drake:proximity_properties>
          <drake:compliant_hydroelastic/>
          <drake:mesh_resolution_hint value="0.1"/>
          <drake:hydroelastic_modulus value="5e7/>
          <drake:hunt_crossley_dissipation value="1.25/>
        </drake:proximity_properties>
      </collision>
    …

For a body, we’ve defined a collision geometry called “body1_collision”. Inside
the <collision> tag (as a sibling to the <geometry> tag), we’ve introduced the
Drake-specific <drake:proximity_properties> tag. In it we’ve defined the
geometry to be compliant for hydroelastic contact and specified its resolution
hint, its hydroelastic modulus, and its dissipation.

Let’s look at the specific tags:

- <@ref tag_drake_proximity_properties>: This is the container for all
  Drake-specific proximity property values.
- The following tags define hydroelastic properties for the collision geometry
  and would be contained in the <@ref tag_drake_proximity_properties> tag.
  - <@ref tag_drake_rigid_hydroelastic> or
    <@ref tag_drake_compliant_hydroelastic>
  - <@ref tag_drake_mesh_resolution_hint>
  - <@ref tag_drake_hydroelastic_modulus> (for compliant geometry only)
  - <@ref tag_drake_hunt_crossley_dissipation>
- In the name of completeness, the following tags would be children of the
  <@ref tag_drake_proximity_properties> tag as well, but are not restricted to
  use with hydroelastic contact.
  - <@ref tag_drake_point_contact_stiffness>: Only used when this geometry is
    for point contact. Defines the compliance of the point contact. This
    property is allowed to exist even if the geometry has been specified to be
    of hydroelastic type, it will have no effect on hydroelastic computations.
  - <@ref tag_drake_mu_static> The coefficient for static friction; this
    applies to both point contact and hydroelastic contact.
  - <@ref tag_drake_mu_dynamic> The coefficient for dynamic friction; this
    applies to both point contact and hydroelastic contact.

@subsubsection hug_code_properties Assigning hydroelastic properties in code

Hydroelastic properties can be set to objects programmatically via the following
APIs (see their documentation for further details):

- AddContactMaterial()
- AddRigidHydroelasticProperties()
- AddCompliantHydroelasticProperties()
- AddCompliantHydroelasticPropertiesForHalfSpace()

Some extra notes:

AddContactMaterial() isn’t hydroelastic contact specific, but does provide a
mechanism for setting the friction coefficients that hydroelastic and point
contact models both use.

AddRigidHydroelasticProperties() is overloaded. One version accepts a value for
resolution hint, one does not. When in doubt which to use, it is harmless to
provide a resolution hint value that would be ignored for some geometries, but
failing to provide one where necessary will cause the simulation to throw an
exception.  Note the special case for declaring a compliant half space -- it
takes the required slab thickness parameter in addition to the hydroelastic
modulus value.

@section hug_visualizing Visualizing hydroelastic contact

Start Meldis by:

    $ bazel run //tools:meldis -- --open-window &

Run a simulation with hydroelastic contact model; for example,

    $ bazel run //examples/hydroelastic/ball_plate:ball_plate_run_dynamics -- \
       --mbp_dt=0.001 --x0=0.10 --z0=0.15 --vz=-7.0 \
       --simulation_time=0.015 --simulator_publish_every_time_step

At the time of this writing, the Meldis view of this example looks like this:

@image html "multibody/hydroelastics/images/drake-vis-01.png" width=90%

In the above picture, we see two red force vectors acting at the centroids of
the two contact surfaces and also the two blue moment vectors. One contact
surface represents the ball pushing the dinner plate down. The other contact
surface represents the rectangular floor pushing the dinner plate up. (Gravity
forces are not shown, nor is the contact between the ball and the floor.) Notice
that only approximately half of the bottom of the plate makes contact with the
floor.

The Scene panel can toggle on/off many different aspects of the visualization
using checkboxes, including: which contacts are shown, whether to view the
illustration (visual) geometry and/or collision (proximity) geometry and/or the
bodies' inertia, as well as sliders for controlling transparency to better view
overlapping shapes.

When viewing collisions, note that red arrows indicate a hydroelastic contact,
with an associated contact patch. Green arrows indicate point contact, which
does not have any contact patch.

@section hug_pitfalls Pitfalls/Troubleshooting

Here are various ways that hydroelastic contact may surprise you.
- A rigid body is not a rigid hydroelastic body until users say so (see
  @ref creating_hydro_reps). Otherwise, it is ignored by the hydroelastic
  contact model and might get point contact instead.
  - Users need to call AddRigidHydroelasticProperties() or use the URDF or
    SDFormat tag <drake:rigid_hydroelastic/>.
- Backface culling -- the visualized contact surface is not what you
  expect. Or, “Why are there holes?”
  <!-- TODO(rpoyner-tri): This should come with some illustrations to make this
       clear. -->
- Hydroelastic modulus is not properly a material property; it combines
  material and geometry.
  - Make the sphere bigger, the force gets weaker for the same contact surface.
- “I don’t seem to be getting any contact surfaces although my spheres are
  clearly overlapping!” Depending on how coarsely you tessellated your geometry
  (a sphere, at its coarsest, is an octahedron), there can be a large amount of
  error between the primitive surface and discrete mesh’s surface. Make sure
  you visualize the hydro meshes and have what you expect.
- Stiff and coarse is seldom a good thing. The stiffer an object is, the more
  the details of the discrete tessellation will directly contribute to the
  dynamics.
  <!-- TODO(rpoyner-tri): Ideally, there should be a demo that shows a coarse
       sphere with decreasing elasticity rolling would be good. One rolls like
       an 8-sided dice.  One more closely approximates a sphere. -->
- Getting moments out of the contact depends on how many elements are in the
  contact surface. If the elements of the two contributing meshes are much
  larger than the actual contact surface, the contact can become, in essence,
  point contact.
- Half spaces are not represented by meshes. They don’t contribute *any*
  geometry to the resultant contact surface. The contact surface’s refinement
  will depend on the other geometry’s level of refinement.

@subsection hug_tips Tips and Tricks

This is a random collection of things we can do to maximize the benefits of the
hydroelastic contact model. Some of these tricks accommodate current
implementation limitations, and some are to work within the theoretical
framework.

@subsubsection hug_gaming Gaming the model

- Rigid meshes need not be closed. You can use this to provide fine grained
  control over where a contact surface can actually exist. Be careful to have a
  consistent direction of surface normals on the triangles. They should point
  outward.

- For a given relative configuration between bodies, the magnitude of force can
  be tuned in two ways: increasing the hydroelastic modulus and/or scaling the
  geometry up (in essence, increasing the average penetration depth).

@section hydro_appendix_a Appendix A: Current state of implementation

This section will be updated as the scope and feature set of
hydroelastic contact is advanced. The main crux of this section is to clearly
indicate what can and cannot be done with hydroelastic contact.

@subsection hug_implemented What can you do with hydroelastic contact?

- Hydroelastic contact can be used with MultibodyPlant in either continuous or
  discrete mode.
- You can visualize the contact surfaces, their pressure fields, and the
  resultant contact forces in MeshCat as the simulation progresses. However,
  for playing back recordings in MeshCat, only the contact forces and moments
  are available (see issue
  [19142](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/19142)).
- All Drake Shape types can be used to create rigid hydroelastic bodies (this
  includes arbitrary meshes defined as OBJs).
- Drake primitive Shape types (Box, Capsule, Cylinder, Ellipsoid, HalfSpace,
  and Cylinder) can all be used to create both compliant hydroelastic bodies
  and rigid hydroelastic bodies.
- The Drake Convex Shape type can be used both as a compliant hydroelastic body
  and a rigid hydroelastic body. To use Convex, add the custom tag
  `<drake:declare_convex/>` tag under the `<mesh>` tag in either an SDFormat
  or URDF file.
- The Drake Mesh Shape type can be used as a compliant hydroelastic body
  using a tetrahedral mesh in VTK file.
  See
  [examples/hydroelastic/python_nonconvex_mesh.]
  (https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/tree/master/examples/hydroelastic/python_nonconvex_mesh)

@subsection hug_not_yet_implemented What can’t you do with hydroelastic contact?

- You can’t get contact surfaces between two rigid hydroelastic geometries.
  The contact surface between rigid geometries is ill defined and will most
  likely never be supported.
  The default drake::multibody::ContactModel::kHydroelasticWithFallback uses
  compliant point contact as a reliable default. See @ref hug_enabling.
- Hydroelastics cannot model true deformations given the model does not
  introduce state. Therefore effects such as tangential compliance or
  short time scale waves are not captured by the model.
  Currently we are actively developing code for deformable bodies in
  @ref drake::multibody::DeformableModel.

@subsection hug_dissipation_and_solver Current dissipation models

- The TAMSI (DiscreteContactApproximation::kTamsi), Similar
  (DiscreteContactApproximation::kSimilar), and Lagged
  (DiscreteContactApproximation::kLagged) model approximations use a
  Hunt-Crossley model of dissipation, parameterized by
  `hunt_crossley_dissipation`, for both point and hydroelastic contact. The SAP
  approximation parameter `relaxation_time` is ignored by these approximations.
- The SAP model approximation (DiscreteContactApproximation::kSap) uses a linear
  Kelvin–Voigt model of dissipation parameterized by `relaxation_time`, for both
  point and hydroelastic contact. The Hunt-Crossley dissipation parameter is
  ignored by this approximation.
- We allow the user to specify both `hunt_crossley_dissipation` (TAMSI, Similar
  and Lagged discrete approximations as well as continuous plant model) and
  `relaxation_time` (SAP approximation specific parameter) on the model, but the
  parameter may be ignored depending on your plant configuration. See the
  documentation for that in the [MultibodyPlant documentation.]
