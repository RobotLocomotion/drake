/// @name Inclined plane with a rigid body.
/// These functions create an inclined plane A and possibly a uniform-density
/// rigid body B with user-defined geometry and surface friction properties and
/// adds them to an existing plant.
/// The inclined plane can be modeled as an infinite half-space or as a box with
/// user-defined dimensions.  The inclined plane's top surface is located so
/// that it passes through point Wo (the origin of world W).  Right-handed
/// orthonormal vectors Wx, Wy, Wz are fixed in the world W.  Similarly,
/// Ax, Ay, Az are fixed in the inclined plane A and Bx, By, Bz are fixed in
/// body B.  Wz is directed vertically upward (opposite Earth's gravity).  The
/// inclined plane A is oriented by initially setting Ax=Wx, Ay=Wy, Az=Wz, and
/// then subjecting A to a right-handed rotation about Ay=Wy.
///
/// Some of these functions also add a rigid body B (e.g., a block or sphere)
/// with user-defined mass.
/// @anchor inclined_plane_parameters
/// @param[in] gravity The magnitude of Earth's local gravitational acceleration
///   in m/sÂ².  Earth's gravity is in the world's -z direction.
/// @param[in] inclined_plane_angle Inclined plane angle (slope) i.e., angle
///   from Wx to Ax with positive sense Wy (radians).
/// @param[in] inclined_plane_dimensions Optional box dimensions (meters) in the
///   Ax, Ay, Az directions.  If dimensions are given, the inclined plane is
///   modeled as a box, otherwise it is a half-space.
/// @param[in] coefficient_friction_inclined_plane Coulomb's coefficient of
