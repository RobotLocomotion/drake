  /// @name Methods to retrieve multibody element variants
  ///
  /// Given two variants of the same %MultibodyTree, these methods map an
  /// element in one variant, to its corresponding element in the other variant.
  ///
  /// A concrete case is the call to ToAutoDiffXd() to obtain a
  /// %MultibodyTree variant templated on AutoDiffXd from a %MultibodyTree
  /// templated on `double`. Typically, a user holding a `Body<double>` (or any
  /// other multibody element in the original variant templated on `double`)
  /// would like to retrieve the corresponding `Body<AutoDiffXd>` variant from
  /// the new AutoDiffXd tree variant.
  ///
  /// Consider the following code example:
  /// @code
  ///   // The user creates a model.
  ///   MultibodyTree<double> model;
  ///   // User adds a body and keeps a reference to it.
  ///   const RigidBody<double>& body = model.AddBody<RigidBody>(...);
  ///   // User creates an AutoDiffXd variant. Variants on other scalar types
  ///   // can be created with a call to CloneToScalar().
  ///   std::unique_ptr<MultibodyTree<Tvariant>> variant_model =
  ///       model.ToAutoDiffXd();
  ///   // User retrieves the AutoDiffXd variant corresponding to the original
  ///   // body added above.
