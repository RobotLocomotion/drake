/// _Articulated %Body Inertia_ is the inertia that a body appears to have when
/// it is the base (or root) of a rigid-body system, also referred to as
/// _Articulated %Body_ in the context of articulated body algorithms.
/// The _Articulated %Body Inertia_ is a very useful multibody dynamics concept
/// that was introduced by Featherstone [Featherstone 1983] to develop the
/// remarkable `O(n)` Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA) for solving forward
/// dynamics. Recall that the Newton-Euler equations allow us to describe the
/// combined rotational and translational dynamics of a rigid body: <pre>
///   F_BBo_W = M_B_W * A_WB + b_Bo_W                                    (1)
/// </pre>
/// where the spatial inertia (see SpatialInertia) `M_B_W` of body B expressed
/// in the world frame W linearly relates the spatial acceleration (see
/// SpatialAcceleration) of body B in the world frame with the total applied
/// spatial forces (see SpatialForce) `F_BBo` on body B and where `b_Bo_W`
/// contains the velocity dependent gyroscopic terms.
///
/// A similar relationship is found for an articulated body with a rigid body B
/// at the base (or root). Even though the bodies in this multibody system are
/// allowed to have relative motions among them, there still is a linear
/// relationship between the spatial force `F_BBo_W` applied on this body and
/// the resulting acceleration `A_WB`: <pre>
///   F_BBo_W = P_B_W * A_WB + z_Bo_W                                       (2)
/// </pre>
/// where `P_B_W` is the articulated body inertia of body B and `z_Bo_W` is a
/// bias force that includes the gyroscopic and Coriolis forces and becomes zero
/// when all body velocities and all applied generalized forces outboard
/// from body B are zero [Jain 2010, §7.2.1]. The articulated body inertia
/// `P_B_W` is related to the multibody subsystem consisting only of bodies that
/// are outboard of body B. We refer to this subsystem as the
/// _articulated body subsystem_ associated with body B. Equation (2) describes
/// the acceleration response of body B, but also taking into account all
/// outboard bodies connected to B. A special case is that of an articulated
/// body composed of a single rigid body. For this special case, Eq. (2) reduces
/// to Eq. (1) for the dynamics of rigid body B. In other words, the ABI for an
/// articulated body consisting of a single rigid body exactly equals the
/// spatial inertia of that body.
///
/// Articulated body inertias are elements of ℝ⁶ˣ⁶ that, as for spatial
/// inertias, are symmetric and positive semi-definite. However, ABI objects
/// **are not** spatial inertias. The spatial inertia of a rigid body can be
/// described by a reduced set of ten parameters, namely the mass, center of
/// mass and the six components of the rotational inertia for that body.
/// However, this parametrization by ten parameters is just not possible for an
/// ABI and the full 21 elements of the symmetric `6x6` matrix must be specified
/// [Jain 2010, §6.4]. As a result ABI objects can have different properties
/// than spatial inertia objects. As an example, the apparent mass of an
/// articulated body will in general depend on the direction of the applied
/// force. That is, the simple relationship `F = m * a` is no longer valid for
/// an articulated body's center of mass (refer to the excellent example 7.1 in
/// [Featherstone 2008]).
///
/// We adopt the notation introduced by [Jain 2010] and generally we will use
/// an uppercase P to represent an ABI. Thus, in typeset material we use the
/// symbol @f$ [P^{A/Q}]_E @f$ to represent the spatial inertia of an
/// articulated body A, about a point Q, expressed in a frame E. For this
/// inertia, the monogram notation reads `P_AQ_E`.
///
/// @note This class does not implement any mechanism to track the frame E in
/// which an articulated body inertia is expressed or about what point is
/// computed. Methods and operators on this class have no means to determine
/// frame consistency through operations. It is therefore the responsibility of
/// users of this class to keep track of frames in which operations are
/// performed. We suggest doing that using disciplined notation, as described
/// above.
