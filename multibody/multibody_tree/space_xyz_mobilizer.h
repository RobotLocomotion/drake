/// This mobilizer models a gimbal joint between an inboard frame F and an
/// outboard frame M that allows frame M to rotate freely with respect to F (
/// though a gimbal joint provides arbitrary orientation like a ball joint but
/// with some restrictions, discussed below). No translational motion of M in F
/// is allowed and the inboard frame origin `Fo` and the outboard frame origin
/// `Mo` are coincident at all times.
///
/// The orientation `R_FM` of the outboard frame M in F is parametrized with
/// space `x-y-z` Euler angles (also known as extrinsic angles). That is, the
/// generalized coordinates for this mobilizer correspond to angles
/// θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, for a sequence of rotations about the x̂, ŷ, ẑ axes solidary with
/// frame F, respectively. Mathematically, rotation `R_FM` is given in terms of
/// angles θ₁, θ₂, θ₃ by: <pre>
///   R_FM(q) = Rz(θ₃) * Ry(θ₂) * Rx(θ₁)
/// </pre>
/// where `Rx(θ)`, `Ry(θ)` and `Rz(θ)` correspond to the elemental rotations in
/// amount of θ about the x, y and z axes respectively.
/// Zero θ₁, θ₂, θ₃ angles define the "zero configuration" which corresponds
/// to frames F and M being coincident, see set_zero_configuration().
/// Angles θ₁, θ₂, θ₃ are defined to be positive according to the
/// right-hand-rule with the thumb aligned in the direction of their respective
/// axes.
///
/// The generalized velocities for this mobilizer correspond to the angular
/// velocity `w_FM` of frame M in F, expressed in frame F.
/// MapVelocityToQDot() maps the angular velocity `w_FM` to Euler angles's rates
/// while MapQDotToVelocity() maps Euler angles's rates to angular velocity
/// `w_FM`.
/// While the mapping MapVelocityToQDot() always exists, its inverse
/// MapQDotToVelocity() is singular for values of θ₂ (many times referred to as
/// the pitch angle) such that `θ₂ = π/2 + kπ, ∀ k ∈ ℤ`.
///
/// @note Space `x-y-z` angles (extrinsic) are equivalent to Body `z-y-x` angles
/// (intrinsic).
///
/// @note This particular choice of generalized coordinates θ₁, θ₂, θ₃ for this
/// mobilizer is many times referred to as the roll, pitch and yaw angles by
/// many dynamicists. They are also known as the Tait-Bryan angles or Cardan
/// angles.
///
