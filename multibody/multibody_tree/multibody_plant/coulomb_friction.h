/// Parameters for Coulomb's Law of Friction, namely:
/// - Static friction coefficient, for a pair of surfaces at rest relative to
///   each other.
/// - Dynamic (or kinematic) friction coefficient, for a pair of surfaces in
///   relative motion.
/// These coefficients are an empirical property characterizing the
/// interaction by friction between a pair of contacting surfaces. Friction
/// coefficients depend upon the mechanical properties of the surfaces'
/// materials and on the roughness of the surfaces. They are determined
/// experimentally.
///
/// Even though the Coulomb's law coefficients of friction characterize a pair
/// of surfaces interacting by friction, we associate the abstract __idea__ of
/// friction coefficients to a single surface by considering the coefficients
/// for contact between two identical surfaces. For this case of two identical
/// surfaces, the friction coefficients that describe the surface pair are taken
/// to equal those of one of the identical surfaces. We extend this idea to the
/// case of different surfaces by defining a __combination law__ that allow us
/// to obtain the Coulomb's law coefficients of friction characterizing the pair
/// of surfaces, given the individual friction coefficients of each surface.
/// We would like this __combination law__ to satisfy:
/// - The friction coefficient of two identical surfaces is the friction
///   coefficient of one of the surfaces.
/// - The combination law is commutative. That is, surface A combined with
///   surface B gives the same results as surface B combined with surface A.
/// - For two surfaces M and N with very different friction coefficients, say
///   `μₘ ≪ μₙ`, the combined friction coefficient should be in the order of
///   magnitude of the smallest friction coefficient (in the example μₘ). To
///   understand this requirement, consider rubber (high friction coefficient)
///   sliding on ice (low friction coefficient). We'd like the surface pair
///   to be defined by a friction coefficient close to that of ice, since rubber
///   will easily slide on ice.
/// These requirements are met by the following ad-hoc combination law:
/// <pre>
///   μ = 2μₘμₙ/(μₘ + μₙ)
/// </pre>
/// See CalcContactFrictionFromSurfaceProperties(), which implements this law.
/// More complex combination laws could also be a function of other parameters
/// such as the mechanical properties of the interacting surfaces or even their
/// roughnesses. For instance, if the the rubber surface above has metal studs
/// (somehow making the surface "rougher"), it will definitely have a better
/// grip on an ice surface. Therefore this new variable should be taken into
/// account in the combination law. Notice that in this example, this new
/// combination law model for tires, will have a different set of requirements
/// from the ones stated above.
///
/// @tparam T The scalar type. Must be a valid Eigen scalar.
///
