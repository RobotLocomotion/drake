  /// Currently %MultibodyPlant uses a rigid contact model that is, bodies in
  /// the model are infinitely stiff or ideal rigid bodies. Therefore, the
  /// mathematical description of the rigid contact model needs to include
  /// non-penetration constraints among bodies in the formulation. There are
  /// several numerical methods to impose and solve these constraints.
  /// In a penalty method approach, we allow for a certain amount of
  /// interpenetration and we compute contact forces according to a simple law
  /// of the form: <pre>
  ///   fₙ = k(1+dẋ)x
  /// </pre>
  /// where the normal contact force `fₙ` is made a continuous function of the
  /// penetration distance x between the bodies (defined to be
  /// positive when the bodies are in contact) and the penetration distance
  /// rate ẋ (with ẋ > 0 meaning the penetration distance is increasing and
  /// therefore the interpenetration between the bodies is also increasing).
  /// k and d are the penalty method coefficients for stiffness and damping.
  /// These are ad-hoc parameters which need to be tuned as a trade-off between:
  /// - The accuracy of the numerical approximation to rigid contact, which
  ///   requires a stiffness that approaches infinity, and
  /// - the computational cost of the numerical integration, which will
  ///   require smaller time steps for stiffer systems.
  ///
  /// There is no exact procedure for choosing these coefficients, and
  /// estimating them manually can be cumbersome since in general they will
  /// depend on the scale of the problem including masses, speeds and even
  /// body sizes. However, %MultibodyPlant aids the estimation of these
  /// coefficients using a heuristic function based on a user-supplied
  /// "penetration allowance", see set_penetration_allowance(). The penetration
  /// allowance is a number in meters that specifies the order of magnitude of
  /// the average penetration between bodies in the system that the user is
  /// willing to accept as reasonable for the problem being solved. For
  /// instance, in the robotics manipulation of ordinary daily objects the user
  /// might set this number to 1 millimeter. However, the user might want to
  /// increase it for the simulation of heavy walking robots for which an
  /// allowance of 1 millimeter would result in a very stiff system.
  ///
  /// As for the damping coefficient in the simple law above, %MultibodyPlant
  /// chooses the damping coefficient d to model inelastic collisions and
  /// therefore sets it so that the penetration distance x behaves as a
  /// critically damped oscillator. That is, at the limit of ideal rigid contact
  /// (very stiff penalty coefficient k or equivalently the penetration
  /// allowance goes to zero), this method behaves as a unilateral constraint on
  /// the penetration distance, which models a perfect inelastic collision. For
  /// most applications, such as manipulation and walking, this is the desired
  /// behavior.
  ///
  /// When set_penetration_allowance() is called, %MultibodyPlant will estimate
  /// reasonable penalty method coefficients as a function of the input
  /// penetration allowance. Users will want to run their simulation a number of
  /// times and asses they are satisfied with the level of inter-penetration
  /// actually observed in the simulation; if the observed penetration is too
  /// large, the user will want to set a smaller penetration allowance. If the
  /// system is too stiff and the time integration requires very small time
  /// steps while at the same time the user can afford larger
  /// inter-penetrations, the user will want to increase the penetration
  /// allowance. Typically, the observed penetration will be
  /// proportional to the penetration allowance. Thus scaling the penetration
  /// allowance by say a factor of 0.5, would typically results in
  /// inter-penetrations being reduced by the same factor of 0.5.
  /// In summary, users should choose the largest penetration allowance that
  /// results in inter-penetration levels that are acceptable for the particular
  /// application (even when in theory this penetration should be zero for
  /// perfectly rigid bodies.)
  ///
  /// For a given penetration allowance, the contact interaction that takes two
  /// bodies with a non-zero approaching velocity to zero approaching velocity,
  /// takes place in a finite amount of time (for ideal rigid contact this time
  /// is zero.) A good estimate of this time period is given by a call to
  /// get_contact_penalty_method_time_scale(). Users might want to query this
  /// value to either set the maximum time step in error-controlled time
  /// integration or to set the time step for fixed time step integration.
  /// As a guidance, typical fixed time step integrators will become unstable
  /// for time steps larger than about a tenth of this time scale.
