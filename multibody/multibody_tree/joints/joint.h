/// A %Joint models the kinematical relationship which characterizes the
/// possible relative motion between two bodies.
/// The two bodies connected by a %Joint object are referred to as the
/// _parent_ and _child_ bodies. Although the terms _parent_ and _child_ are
/// sometimes used synonymously to describe the relationship between inboard and
/// outboard bodies in multibody models, this usage is wholly unrelated and
/// implies nothing about the inboard-outboard relationship between the bodies.
/// A %Joint is a model of a physical kinematic constraint between two bodies,
/// a constraint that in the real physical system does not even allude to the
/// ordering of the bodies.
///
/// In Drake we define a frame F rigidly attached to the parent body P with pose
/// `X_PF` and a frame M rigidly attached to the child body B with pose `X_BM`.
/// A %Joint object specifies a kinematic relation between frames F and M,
/// which in turn imposes a kinematic relation between bodies P and B.
///
/// Typical joints include the ball joint, to allow unrestricted rotations about
/// a given point, the revolute joint, that constraints two bodies to rotate
/// about a given common axis, etc.
///
/// Consider the following example to build a simple pendulum system:
///
/// @code
/// MultibodyTree<double> model;
/// // ... Code here to setup quantities below as mass, com, etc. ...
/// const Body<double>& pendulum =
///   model.AddBody<RigidBody>(SpatialInertia<double>(mass, com, unit_inertia));
/// // We will connect the pendulum body to the world using a RevoluteJoint.
/// // In this simple case the parent body P is the model's world body and frame
/// // F IS the world frame.
/// // Additionally, we need to specify the pose of frame M on the pendulum's
/// // body frame B.
/// // Say we declared and initialized X_BM...
/// const RevoluteJoint<double>& elbow =
///   model.AddJoint<RevoluteJoint>(
///     "Elbow",                /* joint name */
///     model.world_body(),     /* parent body */
///     {},                     /* frame F IS the world frame W */
///     pendulum,               /* child body, the pendulum */
///     X_BM,                   /* pose of frame M in the body frame B */
///     Vector3d::UnitZ());     /* revolute axis in this case */
/// @endcode
///
