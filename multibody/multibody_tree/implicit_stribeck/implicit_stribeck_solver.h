/// This struct implements an internal (thus within `internal::`) detail of the
/// implicit Stribeck solver. The implicit Stribeck solver performs a
/// Newton-Raphson iteration, and at each kth iteration, it computes a
/// tangential velocity update Δvₜᵏ. One Newton strategy would be to compute
/// the tangential velocity at the next iteration (k+1) as
/// vₜᵏ⁺¹ = vₜᵏ + αΔvₜᵏ, where 0 < α < 1, is a coefficient obtained by line
/// search to improve convergence.
/// Line search works very well for smooth problems. However, even though the
/// implicit Stribeck is solving the root of a continuous function, this
/// function has very steep gradients only within the very small regions close
/// to where the tangential velocities are zero. These regions are circles in
/// ℝ² of radius equal to the stiction tolerance of the solver vₛ. We refer to
/// these circular regions as the "stiction regions" and to their boundaries as
/// the "stiction circles". We refer to the region of ℝ² outside the stiction
/// region around the origin as the "sliding region".
/// The implicit Stribeck solver uses the following modified Stribeck function
/// describing the functional dependence of the Stribeck coefficient of friction
/// μₛ with slip speed: <pre>
///     μₛ(x) = ⌈ μ⋅x⋅(2.0 - x),  x  < 1
///             ⌊ μ            ,  x >= 1
/// </pre>
/// where x corresponds to the dimensionless slip speed x = ‖vₜ‖ / vₛ and
/// μ is the Coulomb's law coefficient of friction. The implicit Stribeck solver
/// makes no distinction between static and dynamic coefficients of friction and
/// therefore a single coefficient μ needs to be specified.
/// The Stribeck function is highly nonlinear and difficult to solve with a
/// conventional Newton-Raphson method. However, it can be partitioned into
/// regions based on how well the local gradients can be used to find a
/// solution. We'll describe the algorithm below in terms of "strong" gradients
/// (∂μ/∂v >> 0) and "weak" gradients (∂μ/∂v ≈ 0). Roughly, the gradients are
/// strong during stiction and weak during sliding.
/// These regions are so small compared to the velocity scales dealt with
/// by the implicit Stribeck solver, that effectively, the Newton-Raphson
/// iterate would only "see" a fixed dynamic coefficient of friction and it
/// would never be able to predict stiction. That is, if search direction Δvₜᵏ
/// computed by the Newton-Raphson algorithm is not limited in some way, the
/// iteration would never fall within the stiction regions where gradients
/// are "strong" to guide the convergence of the solution, to either stiction
/// or sliding.
///
/// The remedy to this situation is to limit changes in the tangential
/// velocities at each iteration. The situation described above, in which an
/// update  Δvₜᵏ "misses" the stiction circle can be described in purely
/// geometric terms. We exploit this fact to devise a strategy that is
/// appropriate for this particular problem. We use the methodology outlined in
/// [Uchida et al., 2015] and describe particulars to our implementation below.
///
/// LimitDirectionChange implements a specific strategy with knowledge of the
/// implicit Stribeck iteration procedure. It is important to note that the
/// implicit Stribeck uses "soft norms" to avoid divisions by zero. That is,
/// friction forces are computed according to: <pre>
///   fₜ(vₜ) = -μ(‖vₜ‖ₛ) vₜ/‖vₜ‖ₛ
/// </pre>
/// where, to avoid the singularity at zero velocity, we use a "soft norm"
/// ‖vₜ‖ₛ = sqrt(vₜᵀvₜ + εᵥ²), with εᵥ a small fraction of vₛ. Due to the
/// use of soft norms, the gradient of fₜ with vₜ is now well defined,
/// but it goes to zero as vₜ approaches the origin. Therefore, gradients
/// are also "weak" in the neighborhood of ‖vₜ‖ₛ ≲ εᵥ.
/// Due to this, external forcing (either from applied forces or from coupling
/// with other friction forces) has the potential to, mistakenly, force a
/// transition from stiction to sliding. The solver will most likely recover
/// from this, but this will result in a larger number of iterations.
/// LimitDirectionChange considers any tangential velocity vₜ (or change Δvₜ)
/// to be approximately zero if x = ‖vₜ‖/vₛ is smaller than `tolerance`
/// (see docs below, this is a dimensionless number << 1). We define
/// `εᵥ = tolerance⋅vₛ` (with units of m/s).
///
/// In what follows we list a number of special scenarios dealt with by
/// LimitDirectionChange. We use the observations made above.
///  - LimitDirectionChange first deals with the case ‖vₜ‖ < εᵥ to avoid
///    divisions by zero in the subsequent cases. It essentially clips vₜᵏ⁺¹
///    to have magnitude vₛ/2 when the update Δvₜᵏ ≠ 0. For small updates
///    Δvₜᵏ leading to vₜᵏ⁺¹ within the stiction region, we take  α = 1.
///    See implementation notes for CalcAlpha() for further details.
///  - Transition from ‖vₜ‖ < εᵥ (stiction) to ‖vₜ‖/vₛ > 1 (sliding). Since
///    we are in a region of "weak" gradients (due to "norm softening",
///    see discussion above), we limit the update to vₜᵏ⁺¹ = vₜᵏ/‖vₜᵏ‖⋅vₛ/2.
///    In other words, if the speed would grow too fast, we cap it at vₛ/2
///    so that at least two Newton iterations are required to go from near-0
///    sticking to sliding.
///  - Transition from sliding ‖vₜᵏ‖/vₛ > 1 to an almost perfect stiction with
///    ‖vₜᵏ⁺¹‖ < εᵥ. In an attempt to avoid weak gradients for the next
///    iteration, we impose the limit vₜᵏ⁺¹ = vₜᵏ/‖vₜᵏ‖⋅vₛ/2, placing the
///    velocity "in the same direction where it came from", within the stiction
///    region, but where gradients are strong.
///  - Velocity change Δvₜᵏ intersects the stiction circle. To be more precise,
///    the line connecting vₜᵏ and vₜᵏ + Δvₜᵏ crosses the stiction region.
///    This situation implies that most likely a stiction transition could
///    happen but the pure Newton-Raphson would miss it. This situation is
///    outlined in [Uchida et al., 2015]. In this case LimitDirectionChange
///    computes α so that vₜᵏ⁺¹ =  vₜᵏ + αΔvₜᵏ is the closest vector to the
///    origin. This corresponds to the geometric condition
///    dot(vₜᵏ⁺¹, Δvₜᵏ) = 0.
///  - Velocity change Δvₜᵏ does not intersect the stiction circle, i.e.
///    changes happen in a region away from stiction (within the sliding
///    region). However, large angular changes (measured by the angle
///    θ = acos(vₜᵏ⁺¹⋅vₜᵏ/(‖vₜᵏ⁺¹‖‖vₜᵏ‖)) between vₜᵏ⁺¹ and vₜᵏ)
///    might indicate a solution that is attempting to reach a stiction region.
///    In order to aid convergence, we limit the angle change to θₘₐₓ, and
///    therefore (see [Uchida et al., 2015]) we compute α so that
///    θₘₐₓ = acos(vₜᵏ⁺¹⋅vₜᵏ/(‖vₜᵏ⁺¹‖‖vₜᵏ‖)).

/// <h2>Discretization in Time</h2>
/// In this section we provide a detailed derivation of the first order time
/// stepping approach in Eq. (2). We start from the continuous Eq. (1): <pre>
///   (1)  M(q)⋅v̇ = τ + Jₙᵀ(q)⋅fₙ(q, v) + Jₜᵀ(q)⋅fₜ(v)
/// </pre>
/// we can discretize Eq. (1) in time using a first order semi-implicit Euler
/// scheme in velocities: <pre>
///   (4)  M(qⁿ)⋅vⁿ⁺¹ = M(qⁿ)⋅vⁿ +
///           δt (τⁿ⁺¹ + Jₙᵀ(qⁿ)⋅fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ⁺¹) + Jₜᵀ(qⁿ)⋅fₜ(vⁿ⁺¹)) + O₁(δt²)
/// </pre>
/// where the equality holds strictly since we included the leading terms in
/// `O(δt²)`. We use `τⁿ⁺¹ = τ(tⁿ, qⁿ, vⁿ⁺¹)` for brevity in Eq. (4).
/// When moving from the continuous Eq. (1) to the discrete version Eq. (4), we
/// lost the nice property that our compliant normal forces are decoupled from
/// the friction forces (both depend on the same unknown vⁿ⁺¹ in Eq (4)). The
/// reason is that Eq. (4) includes an integration over a small interval of
/// size δt. To solve the discrete system in Eq. (4), we'd like to decouple the
/// normal forces from the tangential forces again, which will require a new
/// (though still valid) approximation.
/// To do so we will expand in Taylor series the term `fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ⁺¹)`: <pre>
///   (5)  fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ⁺¹) = fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ) + ∇ᵥfₙ(qⁿ,vⁿ)⋅(vⁿ⁺¹-vⁿ) + O₂(‖vⁿ⁺¹-vⁿ‖²)
/// </pre>
/// The difference between `vⁿ` and `vⁿ⁺¹` can be written as: <pre>
///   (6)  vⁿ⁺¹-vⁿ = δtv̇ⁿ + δtO₃(δt²) = O₄(δt)
/// </pre>
/// Substituting `vⁿ⁺¹-vⁿ` from Eq. (6) into Eq. (5) we arrive to: <pre>
///   (7)  fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ⁺¹) = fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ) + ∇ᵥfₙ(qⁿ,vⁿ)⋅O₄(δt) + O₅(δt²)
///                     = fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ) + O₆(δt)
/// </pre>
/// where `O₅(δt²) = O₂(‖vⁿ⁺¹-vⁿ‖²) = O₂(‖O₄(δt)‖²)`. A similar argument for
/// τⁿ⁺¹ shows it also differs in O(δt) from τⁿ = τ(tⁿ, qⁿ, vⁿ).
/// We can now use Eq. (7) into Eq. (4) to arrive to: <pre>
///   (8)  M(qⁿ)⋅vⁿ⁺¹ = M(qⁿ)⋅vⁿ +
///         δt (τⁿ + Jₙᵀ(qⁿ)⋅(fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ) + O₆(δt)) + Jₜᵀ(qⁿ)⋅fₜ(vⁿ⁺¹)) +
///         O₁(δt²)
/// </pre>
/// which we can rewrite as: <pre>
///   (9)  M(qⁿ)⋅vⁿ⁺¹ = M(qⁿ)⋅vⁿ +
///       δt (τⁿ + Jₙᵀ(qⁿ)⋅fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ) + Jₜᵀ(qⁿ)⋅fₜ(vⁿ⁺¹)) + O₇(δt²)
/// </pre>
/// with `O₇(δt²) = δt Jₙᵀ(qⁿ)⋅O₆(δt) + O₁(δt²)`.
/// That is, Eq. (9) introduces the same order of approximation as in the
/// semi-implicit method in Eq. (4).
/// Up to this point we have made no approximations but we instead propagated
/// the `O(⋅)` leading terms. Therefore the equalities in the equations above
/// are exact. To obtain an approximate time stepping scheme, we drop `O₇(δt²)`
/// (we neglect it) in Eq. (9) to arrive to a first order scheme:<pre>
///   (10)  M(qⁿ)⋅vⁿ⁺¹ = M(qⁿ)⋅vⁿ +
///                      δt (τⁿ + Jₙᵀ(qⁿ)⋅fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ) + Jₜᵀ(qⁿ)⋅fₜ(vⁿ⁺¹))
/// </pre>
/// Therefore, with the scheme in Eq. (10) we are able to decouple the
/// computation of (compliant) normal forces from that of friction forces.
/// A very important feature of this scheme however, is the explicit nature (in
/// the velocities v) of the term associated with the normal forces (usually
/// including dissipation in the normal direction), which will become unstable
/// for a sufficiently large time step. However, for most applications in
/// practice, the stability of the scheme is mostly determined by the explicit
/// update of normal forces with positions, that is, Eq. (10) is explicit in
/// positions through the normal forces `fₙ(qⁿ, vⁿ)`. For many common
/// applications, the explicit dependence of `τⁿ(tⁿ, qⁿ, vⁿ)` on the
/// previous time step velocities `vⁿ` determines the overall stability of
/// the scheme, since this term can include velocity dependent contributions
/// such as control forces and dampers. Notice that Eq. (5) introduces an
/// expansion of `fₙ` with an order of approximation consistent with the
/// first order scheme as needed. Therefore, it propagates into a `O(δt²)`
