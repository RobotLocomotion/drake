/// N is defined by: <pre>
///   l_NS = ∑l_NQi = ∑mᵢv_NQi
/// </pre>
/// where `mᵢ` and `v_NQi` are the mass and linear velocity (in frame N) of the
/// i-th particle in the system, respectively. Their product `l_NQi = mᵢv_NQi`
/// is the linear momentum of the i-th particle in the N reference frame.
/// The angular momentum `h_NSp` of a system of particles S in a reference frame
/// N about an arbitrary point P is defined by: <pre>
///   h_NSp = ∑ p_PQi x l_NQi
/// </pre>
/// where `p_PQi` is the position vector from point P to the i-th particle
/// position `Qi`.
/// The definitions above extend to a continuum of particles as: <pre>
///   h_NSp = ∫p_PQ(r) x v_NQ(r) ρ(r)d³r
///   l_NS = ∫v_NQ(r) ρ(r)d³r
/// </pre>
/// where `ρ(r)` is the density of the body at each material location `r`.
/// In particular, the continuum version above also applies to rigid bodies.
///
/// Spatial momenta are elements of F⁶ (see [Featherstone 2008]) that combine
/// both rotational (angular momentum) and translational (linear momentum)
/// components. Spatial momenta are 6-element quantities that are pairs of
/// ordinary 3-vectors. Elements 0-2 are the angular momentum component while
/// elements 3-5 are the linear momentum component. As with any other spatial
/// vector, both vector components must be expressed in the same frame.
///
/// Neither the expressed-in frame nor the about-point are stored with a
/// %SpatialMomentum object; they must be understood from context. It is the
/// responsibility of the user to keep track of the about-point and the
/// expressed-in frame. That is best accomplished through disciplined notation.
/// In source code we use monogram notation where L is used to designate a
/// spatial momentum quantity. We write a point P fixed to body (or frame) B as
/// @f$B_P@f$ which appears in code and comments as `Bp`. Then we write as
/// @f$[^NL^{S/B_P}]_E@f$, which appears in code as `L_NBp_E`, the spatial
/// momentum of a body B in a reference frame N, about a point P and, expressed
/// in frame E. Very often the about-point will be the body origin `Bo`; if no
/// point is shown the origin is understood, thus `L_NB_E` means `L_NBo_E`.
/// For a more detailed introduction on spatial vectors and the monogram
/// notation please refer to section @ref multibody_spatial_vectors.
