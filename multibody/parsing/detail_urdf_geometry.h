 <h2>Targeting Renderers</h2>

 In addition to the standard SDF <visual> hierarchy, Drake offers an additional
 tag `<drake:accepting_renderer>`:

 ```
    <visual>
      <geometry ... />
      <drake:accepting_renderer name="renderer_name" />
      ...
    </visual>
 ```

 The new tag serves as a list of renderers for which this visual is targeted.

  - The _value_ of the tag is the name of the renderer.
  - If the _value_ is empty, that is a parsing error.
  - If no instance of `<drake:accepting_renderer>` every renderer will be given
    the chance to reify this visual geometry.
  - Multiple instances of this tag are allowed. Each instance adds a renderer to
    the list of targeted renderers.

 This feature is one way to provide multiple visual representations of a body.

 @param[in] diagnostic The diagnostic handler.
 @param[in] parent_element_name The name of the parent link element, used
 for error reporting.
 @param[in,out] materials The MaterialMap is used to look up materials
 which are referenced by name only in the visual element.  New materials
 which are specified by both color and name will be added to the map and
 can be used by later visual elements.  Material definitions may be
 repeated if the material properties are identical.
 @param[in,out] geometry_names The list of visual geometry names already used
 within the current MbP body (i.e., link), so that this function can be sure not
 to reuse an already-used name. This function adds the name used by the returned
 geometry into this set.
 @param[in] numeric_name_suffix_limit (optional) The upper bound for choosing
                                      numeric suffixes.

/* @anchor urdf_contact_material
 Parses a <collision> element in @p node.

 Reads the definition of a collision geometry (shape, pose, properties, etc.)

 For properties, this function specifically looks for the
 `<drake:proximity_properties>` child tag to find drake-specific geometry
 collision (or "proximity") properties. It looks for the following tags with the
 mapping to properties as show below.

 All of the tags should be of the form:

 @code{xml}
 <tag value="double"/>
 @endcode

 There are not default values for these tags (except for friction -- see below);
 if the tag is missing, the corresponding property will be missing from the
 property set.

 Mapping from URDF tag to geometry property. See
  @ref YET_TO_BE_WRITTEN_HYDROELASTIC_GEOMETRY_MODULE for details on the
 semantics of these properties.

 <h3>Coefficients of friction</h3>

 Parsing coefficients of friction has a relatively complicated protocol:

   1. If one of `<drake:mu_dynamic>` *or* `<drake:mu_static>` is present, the
      property of type CoulombFriction<double> will be instantiated with both
      values initialized to the single value. An error will be emitted
        - if the value is negative.
   2. If both `<drake:mu_dynamic>` and `<drake:mu_static>` tags are present, the
      CoulombFriction<double> will contain both values. An error will be
      emitted if:
        - either value is negative, or
        - `mu_dynamic` is greater than `mu_static`.
   3. If *both* tags are missing, the parser will look for two tags:
      `<drake_compliance><dynamic_friction>` and
      `<drake_compliance><static_friction>` with the same error conditions on
      values.
   4. If no meaningful friction coefficients are found, a default value will be
      created (see default_friction()).
 As long as no error is emitted, the returned geometry::GeometryInstance
 will contain a valid instance of geometry::ProximityProperties with (at least)
 the ('material', 'coulomb_friction') property.
