 <h2>Targeting Renderers</h2>

 In addition to the standard SDF <visual> hierarchy, Drake offers an additional
 tag `<drake:accepting_renderer>`:

 ```
    <visual>
      <geometry ... />
      <drake:accepting_renderer>renderer_name</drake:accepting_renderer>
      ...
    </visual>
 ```

 The new tag serves as a list of renderers for which this visual is targeted.

  - The _value_ of the tag is the name of the renderer.
  - If the _value_ is empty, that is a parsing error.
  - If no instance of `<drake:accepting_renderer>` every renderer will be given
    the chance to reify this visual geometry.
  - Multiple instances of this tag are allowed. Each instance adds a renderer to
    the list of targeted renderers.

 This feature is one way to provide multiple visual representations of a body.

/* Extracts the material properties from the given sdf::Visual object.
 The sdf::Visual object represents a corresponding <visual> tag from an SDF
 file. The material properties are placed into both a
 geometry::IllustrationProperties and geometry::PerceptionProperties as follows:

 <!-- NOTE: Lines longer than 80 columns required for the doxygen tables. -->
 | Group |    Name     |      Type       | Description |
 | :---: | :---------: | :-------------: | :---------- |
 | phong | diffuse     | Vector4<double> | The normalized rgba values for the diffuse color |
 | phong | ambient     | Vector4<double> | The normalized rgba values for the ambient color |
 | phong | specular    | Vector4<double> | The normalized rgba values for the specular color |
 | phong | emissive    | Vector4<double> | The normalized rgba values for the emissive color |
 | phong | diffuse_map | string          | A resolvable URI to a png image that will be applied as a diffuse map. |

 These are properties to be used in the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model">Phong
 lighting model</a> and are taken from the similarly named property tags (see
 below). If any of `ambient`, `diffuse`, `specular`, or `emissive` tags are
 missing, that property will be omitted from the property set and the impact
 of those missing properties will depend on the downstream consumers documented
 handling of missing parameters. If any of the tags are malformed, sdformat
 will treat those properties as "missing" and they will not be included in
 the property set.

 <!-- TODO(SeanCurtis-TRI): Consider changing the behavior for unspecified tags
 to provide the material value as specified in the current (12/11/18) sdf
 specification (http://sdformat.org/spec?ver=1.6&elem=material).
 This is captured in the issue:
 https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/10193 -->

 The material properties come from the child <material> tag. E.g.,
 @code{xml}
 <visual>
   <geometry>
   ...
   </geometry>
   <material>
     <ambient>r_a g_a b_a a_a</ambient>
     <diffuse>r_d g_d b_d a_d</diffuse>
     <specular>r_s g_s b_s a_s</specular>
     <emissive>r_e g_e b_e a_e</emissive>
   </material>
 </visual>
 @endcode

 An instance of geometry::IllustrationProperties will always be returned. If
 there is no material tag, no material property tags, or no successfully
 parsed material property tags, the property set will be empty.  */

    const sdf::Visual& sdf_visual, ResolveFilename resolve_filename);

/* Computes the pose `X_LC` of frame C (the "canonical frame" of the geometry)

 element.  */

/* @anchor sdf_contact_material
 Parses the drake-relevant collision properties from a <collision> element.

 Specifically, looks for <drake:proximity_properties> tag to find drake-specific
 geometry collision (or "proximity") properties. The set of tags are enumerated
 in the table below. Each tag should be of the form:

 @code{xml}
   <tag>real_value</tag>
 @endcode

 As long as no exceptions are thrown, the function is guaranteed to return
 a valid instance of ProximityProperties. There are not default values for these
 tags (except for friction -- see below); if the tag is missing, the
 corresponding property will be missing from the property set.

 <h3>Coefficients of friction</h3>

 Parsing coefficients of friction has a relatively complicated protocol:

   1. If one of `<drake:mu_dynamic>` *or* `<drake:mu_static>` is present, the
      property of type CoulombFriction<double> will be instantiated with both
      values initialized to the single value. An exception will be thrown
        - if the value is negative.
   2. If both `<drake:mu_dynamic>` and `<drake:mu_static>` tags are present, the
      CoulombFriction<double> will contain both values. An exception will be
      thrown if:
        - either value is negative, or
        - `mu_dynamic` is greater than `mu_static`.
   3. If *both* tags are missing, the parser will look for two coefficients
      in the SDF tag path: `<surface><friction><ode><mu>` and
      `<surface><friction><ode><mu2>`.
        a. See MakeCoulombFrictionFromSdfCollisionOde() for failure modes.
   4. If no meaningful friction coefficients are found, a default value will be
      created (see default_friction()).
 As long as no exception is thrown, the resulting ProximityProperties will have
 the ('material', 'coulomb_friction') property.  */
geometry::ProximityProperties MakeProximityPropertiesForCollision(
        const sdf::Collision& sdf_collision);

/* Parses friction coefficients from `sdf_collision`.
 This method looks for the definitions specific to ODE, as given by the SDF
 specification in `<collision><surface><friction><ode>`. Drake understands
 `<mu>` as the static coefficient of friction and `<mu2>` as the dynamic
 coefficient of friction. Consider the example below:
 ```xml
   <collision>
     <surface>
       <friction>
         <ode>
           <mu>0.8</mu>
           <mu2>0.3</mu2>
         </ode>
       </friction>
     </surface>
   </collision>
 ```
 If mu or mu2 (or both) are not found, it returns the default coefficients of
 mu = mu2 = 1, consistent with the SDFormat specification. */
