Drake's drake::multibody::Parser accepts model files written in a variety of
input formats. Drake's parsing of URDF, SDFormat, and MJCF (Mujoco XML) has
Drake-specific extensions and limitations.

The result of the parse is an in-memory model realized within
drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant and (optionally)
drake::geometry::SceneGraph. Note that parses that do not use a `SceneGraph`
will effectively ignore geometric model elements, especially `//visual` and
`//collision` elements.

In the reference sections below, when discussing XML formats, the relevant
usage paths for various tags are indicated using
[XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/) notation.

@section multibody_parsing_dmd Drake Model Directives Support

Drake Model Directives is a Drake-native model description format, primarily
intended for combining models written in other formats into complex scenes. It
is YAML based, and follows a limited data schema.  See
`multibody/parsing/README_model_directives.md` for more detail.

@section multibody_parsing_mjcf MJCF (Mujoco XML) Support

There is limited, undocumented support for parsing MJCF (Mujoco XML) files. The
files are recognized by an .xml file extension. The scope of features that are
actually supported still need to be documented.

<!-- TODO(rpoyner-tri): document mujoco format support -->

@section multibody_parsing_sdf SDFormat Support
Drake supports SDFormat files following the specification at
http://sdformat.org/spec. As of this writing, the supported spec version is
1.9, but check also the Drake release notes for current status.

For Drake extensions to SDFormat files, see
@ref multibody_parsing_drake_extensions.

Drake's parser does not implement all of the features of SDFormat. In the
future, we intend to update this documentation to itemize what isn't supported.

@subsection model_composition SDFormat model composition

Drake's SDFormat parsing supports composing multiple models into a single
model, via lexical nesting and file inclusion. The file inclusion feature
supports both SDFormat files and URDF files. Note that included URDF files pass
through the Drake URDF parser, with all of it's extensions and limitations.

For full details, see the
<a href='http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=composition_proposal#model-composition-proposed-behavior'>SDFormat documentation of model composition.</a>

An important feature of SDFormat model composition is the ability to
cross-reference features of other models. Cross-references are denoted by using
scoped names.

@subsubsection scoped_names Scoped names

Scoped names allow referring to an element of a model nested within the current
model. They take the form of some number of nested model names, plus the
element name, all joined by the delimiter `::`. Names not using the `::`
delimiter are not considered scoped names; they are used to define or refer to
elements of the current model. For example, suppose that model A contains model
B, which in turn contains model C. Here are some valid scoped names:

- within A:
  - `some_frame_in_A`
  - `B::some_frame_in_B`
  - `B::C::some_frame_in_C`
- within B:
  - `some_frame_in_B`
  - `C::some_frame_in_C`
- within C:
  - `some_frame_in_C`

Note that (deliberately) there is no way to refer to elements outward or upward
from the current model; all names are relative to the current model and can
only refer to the current or a nested model. In particular, names must not
start with `::`; there is no way to denote any "outer" or "outermost" scope.

For a detailed design discussion with examples, see the
<a href='http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=composition_proposal#1-3-name-scoping-and-cross-referencing'>SDFormat documentation of name scoping.</a>

@section multibody_parsing_urdf URDF Support
Drake supports URDF files as described here: http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML.

For Drake extensions to URDF format files, see
@ref multibody_parsing_drake_extensions.

@subsection multbody_parsing_urdf_unsupported URDF not supported by Drake

Drake's parser does not implement all of the features of URDF. Here is a list
of known URDF features that Drake does not use. For each, the parser applies
one of several treaments:

- Issue a warning that the tag is unused.
- Ignore silently, as documented below.
- Apply special treatment, as documented below.

@subsubsection urdf_ignored_warning Tags that provoke a warning

- `/robot/@version`
- `/robot/joint/calibration`
- `/robot/joint/safety_controller`
- `/robot/link/@type`
- `/robot/link/collision/verbose`
- `/robot/transmission/@name`
- `/robot/transmission/flexJoint`
- `/robot/transmission/gap_joint`
- `/robot/transmission/leftActuator`
- `/robot/transmission/passive_joint`
- `/robot/transmission/rightActuator`
- `/robot/transmission/rollJoint`
- `/robot/transmission/use_simulated_gripper_joint`

@subsubsection urdf_ignored_silent Tags ignored silently

- `/robot/gazebo`
- `/robot/transmission/actuator/hardwareInterface`
- `/robot/transmission/joint/hardwareInterface`

@subsubsection urdf_ignored_special Tags given special treatment.

- `/robot/transmission/actuator/mechanicalReduction`
- `/robot/transmission/mechanicalReduction`

Both versions of `mechanicalReduction` will be silently ignored if the supplied
value is 1; otherwise the they will provoke a warning that the value is being
ignored.

@section multibody_parsing_drake_extensions Drake Extensions

Drake extends both SDFormat and URDF in similar ways, to allow access to
Drake-specific features. This section provides a compact reference to all
Drake extensions and their use in both formats.

Note that in both formats, it is proper to declare the `drake:` namespace
prefix. For SDFormat, declare it like this:

    <sdf xmlns:drake="http://drake.mit.edu" version="1.9">

For URDF, declare the namespace prefix like this:

    <robot xmlns:drake="http://drake.mit.edu" name="test_robot">

- SDFormat path: `//model/joint/axis/limit/drake:acceleration`
- URDF path: `/robot/joint/limit/@drake:acceleration`
- Syntax: One floating point value, non-negative.

@subsubsection tag_drake_acceleration_semantics Semantics

If the joint type is one of (continuous, prismatic, revolute), specifies
acceleration limits of (-VALUE, +VALUE). Units are determined by the type of
joint, either radians/sec^2 for continuous and revolute joints, or m/s^2 for
prismatic joints.

@subsection tag_drake_accepting_renderer drake:accepting_renderer

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/visual/drake:accepting_renderer`
- URDF path: `/robot/link/visual/drake:accepting_renderer/@name`
- Syntax: String.

@subsubsection tag_drake_accepting_renderer_semantics Semantics

The tag serves as a list of renderers for which this visual is targeted.

  - The _value_ of the tag is the name of the renderer.
  - If the _value_ is empty, that is a parsing error.
  - If no instance of `<drake:accepting_renderer>` every renderer will be given
    the chance to reify this visual geometry.
  - Multiple instances of this tag are allowed. Each instance adds a renderer to
    the list of targeted renderers.

This feature is one way to provide multiple visual representations of a body.

@subsection tag_drake_capsule drake:capsule

- SDFormat path: `//geometry[parent::visual|parent::collision]/drake:capsule`
- URDF path: `//geometry[parent::visual|parent::collision]/drake:capsule`
- Syntax: Two nested elements `radius` and `length`, each of which contain a
          non-negative floating point value.

@subsubsection tag_drake_capsule_semantics Semantics

Constructs a drake::geometry::Capsule of the given radius (meters) and length
(meters), and adds it to either the visual or collision geometry of the model.

SDFormat note: `drake:capsule` is proposed for deprecation; see
[issue #14387](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/14837).

URDF note: Drake supports both `drake:capsule`, and a non-standard
(non-prefixed) `capsule` tag with the same syntax and semantics.

@subsection tag_drake_child drake:child

- SDFormat path: `//model/drake:joint/drake:child`
- URDF path: N/A
- Syntax: String.

@subsubsection tag_drake_child_semantics Semantics

The string names a frame (defined elsewhere in the model) that is associated
with the child link of the joint being defined.

@see @ref tag_drake_joint

@subsection tag_drake_collision_filter_group drake:collision_filter_group

- SDFormat path: `//model/drake:collision_filter_group`
- URDF path: `/robot/drake:collision_filter_group`
- Syntax: Attributes `name` (string) and `ignore` (boolean); nested elements
          `drake:member` and `drake:ignored_collision_filter_group`.

@subsubsection tag_drake_collision_filter_group_semantics Semantics

This element names a group of bodies to participate in collision filtering
rules. If the `ignore` attribute is present and true-valued, the entire element
is skipped during parsing. The nested elements must included one or more
`drake:member` elements, and zero or more
`drake:ignored_collision_filter_group` elements.

This element defines a new group name that is only available during parsing. It
must not be a scoped name.

Collision filtering rules are only constructed with **pairs** of groups, where
both sides of the pair may name the same group. The
`drake:ignored_collision_filter_group` element establishes a pairing between
the group it names and the group within which it is nested. A pair containing
different collision groups excludes collisions between members of those groups
(see drake::geometry::CollisionFilterDeclaration::ExcludeBetween()). A pair
naming the same group twice excludes collisions within the group (see
drake::geometry::CollisionFilterDeclaration::ExcludeWithin()).

@see @ref tag_drake_member, @ref tag_drake_ignored_collision_filter_group, @ref scoped_names

@subsection tag_drake_compliant_hydroelastic drake:compliant_hydroelastic

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/collision/drake:proximity_properties/drake:compliant_hydroelastic`
- URDF path: `/robot/link/collision/drake:proximity_properties/drake:compliant_hydroelastic`
- Syntax: Empty element.

@subsubsection tag_drake_compliant_hydroelastic_semantics Semantics

If present, this element sets the compliance type of the element being defined
to be compliant, as opposed to rigid, in hydroelastic contact models.

@see @ref tag_drake_proximity_properties, @ref creating_hydro_reps

@subsection tag_drake_damping drake:damping

- SDFormat path: `//model/drake:joint/drake:damping`
- URDF path: N/A
- Syntax: Three non-negative floating point values.

@subsubsection tag_drake_damping_semantics Semantics

If the parent joint type is planar, construct a vector from the values (units
of (Nâ‹…s/m, Nâ‹…s/m, Nâ‹…mâ‹…s) respectively) and pass it to the `damping` parameter
of the constructor of drake::multibody::PlanarJoint. The first two values are
for translation; the third is for rotation. See that class for discussion of
units and detailed semantics.

URDF Note: The comparable feature in URDF is the standard
`/robot/joint/dynamics/@damping` attribute.

@subsection tag_drake_declare_convex drake:declare_convex

- SDFormat path: `//geometry[parent::visual|parent::collision]/mesh/drake:declare_convex`
- URDF path: `//geometry[parent::visual|parent::collision]/mesh/drake:declare_convex`
- Syntax: Empty element.

@subsubsection tag_drake_declare_convex_semantics Semantics

If present, this element causes Drake to treat the parent mesh geometry as
convex, without any further validation. The resulting geometry in memory will
be drake::geometry::Convex, rather than drake::geometry::Mesh.

@see drake::geometry::Convex, drake::geometry::Mesh

@subsection tag_drake_diffuse_map drake:diffuse_map

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/visual/material/drake:diffuse_map`

If present, this element indicates (by filename or `package:` URI) a PNG file
to use as a diffuse texture map. The resolved path name is stored in a
PerceptionProperties object under `(phong, diffuse_map)`. URDF provides a
built-in tag, i.e., `//robot/material/texture` or
`//robot/link/visual/material/texture`, to specify a diffuse texture map for a
link.

@see drake::geometry::PerceptionProperties, drake::multibody::PackageMap,
@ref render_engine_vtk_properties "Geometry perception properties"

@subsection tag_drake_ellipsoid drake:ellipsoid

- SDFormat path: `//geometry[parent::visual|parent::collision]/drake:ellipsoid`
- URDF path: `//geometry[parent::visual|parent::collision]/drake:ellipsoid`
- Syntax: Three nested elements (SDFormat) or attributes (URDF) `a`, `b`, `c`,
          each of which contain a positive floating point value.

@subsubsection tag_drake_ellipsoid_semantics Semantics

Constructs a drake::geometry::Ellipsoid with the given half-axis length
parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` (all in units of meters), and adds it to either
the visual or collision geometry of the model.

@subsection tag_drake_gear_ratio drake:gear_ratio

- SDFormat path: `//model/joint/drake:gear_ratio`
- URDF path: `/robot/joint/actuator/drake:gear_ratio@value`
- Syntax: Non-negative floating point value.

@subsubsection tag_drake_gear_ratio_semantics Semantics

Applies the indicated gear ratio value to the appropriate JointActuator
object. This value is only used for reflected inertia calculations, and not as
a torque multiplier. The value is dimensionless for revolute joints, and has
units of 1/m for prismatic joints.

@see drake::multibody::JointActuator, @ref tag_drake_rotor_inertia,
@ref reflected_inertia "Reflected Inertia"

- URDF path: `/robot/link/collision/drake:proximity_properties/drake:hunt_crossley_dissipation/@value`
- Syntax: Non-negative floating point value.

@subsubsection tag_drake_hunt_crossley_dissipation_semantics Semantics

If present, this element provides a value (units of inverse of velocity,
i.e. s/m) for the Hunt-Crossley dissipation model. It is stored in a
ProximityProperties object under `(material, hunt_crossley_dissipation)`.

for the hydroelastic modulus. It is stored in a ProximityProperties object
under `(hydroelastic, hydroelastic_modulus)`.

@see drake::geometry::ProximityProperties,
@ref mbp_hydroelastic_materials_properties "Hydroelastic contact",
@ref hug_properties

@subsection tag_drake_ignored_collision_filter_group drake:ignored_collision_filter_group

- URDF path: `/robot/drake:collision_filter_group/drake:ignored_collision_filter_group/@name`
- Syntax: String.

@subsubsection tag_drake_ignored_collision_filter_group_semantics Semantics

The string names a collision filter group that will be paired with the parent
group when constructing filtering rules. It may name the parent group.

In SDFormat files only, the name may refer to a group within a nested model
(either URDF or SDFormat) by using a scoped name.

@see @ref tag_drake_collision_filter_group, @ref scoped_names

@subsection tag_drake_joint drake:joint

- SDFormat path: `//model/drake:joint`
- URDF path: `/robot/drake:joint`
- Syntax: Attributes `name` (string) and `type` (choice: see below), and nested
          elements (see below).

@subsubsection tag_drake_joint_semantics Semantics

In both formats, the drake:joint element is used as a substitute for standard
joint elements, to allow support for non-standard joint types. The overall
semantics are the same as for a standard joint.

In SDFormat, the only supported `type` value is `planar`. The element must
contain nested `drake:parent`, `drake:child`, and `drake:damping` elements.

In URDF, supported `type` values are one of `ball`, `planar`, `screw` or
`universal`. The nested elements are the same as those defined by the standard
joint element with the exception of the `screw` joint type, which requires
a nested `drake:screw_thread_pitch` element.

@see @ref tag_drake_parent, @ref tag_drake_child, @ref tag_drake_damping,
@ref tag_drake_screw_thread_pitch

@subsection tag_drake_linear_bushing_rpy drake:linear_bushing_rpy

- Syntax: String.

@subsubsection tag_drake_member_semantics Semantics

This element names a link (defined elsewhere in the model) to be a member of
the parent collision filter group.

In SDFormat files only, the name may refer to a link within a nested model
(either URDF or SDFormat) by using a scoped name.

@see @ref tag_drake_collision_filter_group, @ref scoped_names

@subsection tag_drake_mesh_resolution_hint drake:mesh_resolution_hint

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/collision/drake:proximity_properties/drake:mesh_resolution_hint`
- URDF path: `/robot/link/collision/drake:proximity_properties/drake:mesh_resolution_hint/@value`
- Syntax: A positive floating point value.

@subsubsection tag_drake_mesh_resolution_hint_semantics Semantics

The provided value (in units of meters) helps select the resolution of meshes
generated from geometric primitives (sphere, cylinder, capsule, etc.). The
exact semantics depend on the geometry being generated. Within some practical
limits, smaller values will select shorter edge lengths and a finer mesh, larger
values will select longer edge lengths and a coarser mesh.

@see @ref tag_drake_proximity_properties, @ref hug_properties

@subsection tag_drake_mu_dynamic drake:mu_dynamic

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/collision/drake:proximity_properties/drake:mu_dynamic`
