Drake's drake::multibody::Parser accepts model files written in a variety of
input formats. Drake's parsing of URDF, SDFormat, and MJCF (Mujoco XML) has
Drake-specific extensions and limitations.

The result of the parse is an in-memory model realized within
drake::multibody::MultibodyPlant and (optionally)
drake::geometry::SceneGraph. Note that parses that do not use a `SceneGraph`
will effectively ignore geometric model elements, especially `//visual` and
`//collision` elements. Without a `SceneGraph`, deformable models will also
be ignored.

In the reference sections below, when discussing XML formats, the relevant
usage paths for various tags are indicated using
[XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-31/) notation.

@section multibody_parsing_dmd Drake Model Directives Support

Drake Model Directives is a Drake-native model description format, primarily
intended for combining models written in other formats into complex scenes. It
is YAML based, and follows a limited data schema.  See
`multibody/parsing/README_model_directives.md` for more detail.

@section multibody_parsing_mjcf MJCF (Mujoco XML) Support

There is basic support for parsing MJCF (Mujoco XML) files. The files are
recognized by an .xml file extension. The scope of features that are actually
supported still need to be documented here, but the parser does log warnings
for any unsupported MuJoCo XML elements or attributes at runtime.

<!-- TODO(rpoyner-tri): document mujoco format support -->

@subsection mjcf_camera MuJoCo camera support

The MuJoCo camera element is supported (with any unsupported attributes
emitting the standard parser warnings). To parse cameras, you must register a
DiagramBuilder with the Parser, and the MultibodyPlant must have a registered
SceneGraph. The parser will call ApplyCameraConfig() to produce a camera named
"{model_instance_name}/{mjcf_camera_name}", where a default {mjcf_camera_name}
of "camera{i}" for the ith camera (starting from 0) will be provided if no name
is specified in the xml. Note that calling
`MultibodyPlant::RenameModelInstance` after parsing will not update the camera
name.

@subsection mjcf_ignored_silent Tags ignored silently

The following attributes are specific to the MuJoCo solver (listed here in the
order they are listed in the MuJoCo documentation); we have no plans to support
them:

@section multibody_parsing_sdf SDFormat Support
Drake supports SDFormat files following the specification at
http://sdformat.org/spec. As of this writing, the supported spec version is
1.9, but check also the Drake release notes for current status.

For Drake extensions to SDFormat files, see
@ref multibody_parsing_drake_extensions.

Drake's parser does not implement all of the features of SDFormat. In the
future, we intend to update this documentation to itemize what isn't supported.

@subsection model_composition SDFormat model composition

Drake's SDFormat parsing supports composing multiple models into a single
model, via lexical nesting and file inclusion. The file inclusion feature
supports both SDFormat files and URDF files. Note that included URDF files pass
through the Drake URDF parser, with all of its extensions and limitations.

For full details, see the
<a href='http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=composition_proposal#model-composition-proposed-behavior'>SDFormat documentation of model composition.</a>

An important feature of SDFormat model composition is the ability to
cross-reference features of other models. Cross-references are denoted by using
scoped names.

@subsubsection scoped_names Scoped names

Scoped names allow referring to an element of a model nested within the current
model. They take the form of some number of nested model names, plus the
element name, all joined by the delimiter `::`. Names not using the `::`
delimiter are not considered scoped names; they are used to define or refer to
elements of the current model. For example, suppose that model A contains model
B, which in turn contains model C. Here are some valid scoped names:

- within A:
  - `some_frame_in_A`
  - `B::some_frame_in_B`
  - `B::C::some_frame_in_C`
- within B:
  - `some_frame_in_B`
  - `C::some_frame_in_C`
- within C:
  - `some_frame_in_C`

Note that (deliberately) there is no way to refer to elements outward or upward
from the current model; all names are relative to the current model and can
only refer to the current or a nested model. In particular, names must not
start with `::`; there is no way to denote any "outer" or "outermost" scope.

For a detailed design discussion with examples, see the
<a href='http://sdformat.org/tutorials?tut=composition_proposal#1-3-name-scoping-and-cross-referencing'>SDFormat documentation of name scoping.</a>

@subsection tag_deformable_link_requirements Deformable link requirements

Drake supports specifying deformable bodies through SDFormat via custom tags as
an experimental feature. A `<link>` element is interpreted as a deformable body
if it contains a `<drake:deformable_properties>` element
(see @ref tag_drake_deformable_properties). In that case, there are several
requirements that must be satisfied:

- **Exactly one `<collision>` element**: The `<collision>` tag must be present,
  but more than one `<collision>` tag is forbidden.
- **Geometry restriction**: the `<collision>/<geometry>` must contain a single
  `<mesh>` whose URI points to a `.vtk` file that specifies a tetrahedral mesh;
  primitive shapes are not yet supported.  The geometry is used for both
  collision and dynamics.
- **Limited proximity properties**: inside `<collision>`, the only Drake
  proximity tag recognized are `<drake:mu_dynamic>`,
  `<drake:hunt_crossley_dissipation>`, and `drake:relaxation_time>`.
  All other tags are not allowed.
- **At most one `<visual>` element**: The default visual representation of the
  deformable body is the surface of the simulated tetrahedral mesh. However,
  a single `<visual>` element may be present to provide an alternative visual
  representation of the deformable body. Currently, the visual geometry is
  only used for rendering (and the surface of the simulated mesh is *always*
  used for visualization). Therefore, it's only meaningful to specify a non-empty
  `<geometry>` element if the `<drake:perception_properties>` element is not
  disabled; otherwise, the geometry supplied will be ignored with a warning. The
  `<geometry>` element, if non-empty, must contain a single `<mesh>` element, and
  the URI of the mesh must point to a `.obj` file, and the (potentially textured)
  surface described by the `.obj` file is used for rendering. More than one
  `<visual>` is an error.

Violating any of these rules results in a *parsing error*.

@section multibody_parsing_urdf URDF Support
Drake supports URDF files as described here: http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML.

For Drake extensions to URDF format files, see
@ref multibody_parsing_drake_extensions.

@subsection multibody_parsing_urdf_unsupported URDF not supported by Drake

Drake's parser does not implement all of the features of URDF. Here is a list
of known URDF features that Drake does not use. For each, the parser applies
one of several treatments:

- Issue a warning that the tag is unused.
- Ignore silently, as documented below.
- Apply special treatment, as documented below.

@subsubsection urdf_ignored_warning Tags that provoke a warning

- `/robot/@version`
- `/robot/joint/calibration`
- `/robot/joint/safety_controller`
- `/robot/link/@type`
- `/robot/link/collision/verbose`
- `/robot/transmission/@name`
- `/robot/transmission/flexJoint`
- `/robot/transmission/gap_joint`
- `/robot/transmission/leftActuator`
- `/robot/transmission/passive_joint`
- `/robot/transmission/rightActuator`
- `/robot/transmission/rollJoint`
- `/robot/transmission/use_simulated_gripper_joint`

@subsubsection urdf_ignored_silent Tags ignored silently

- `/robot/gazebo`
- `/robot/transmission/actuator/hardwareInterface`
- `/robot/transmission/joint/hardwareInterface`

@subsubsection urdf_ignored_special Tags given special treatment.

- `/robot/transmission/actuator/mechanicalReduction`
- `/robot/transmission/mechanicalReduction`

Both versions of `mechanicalReduction` will be silently ignored if the supplied
value is 1; otherwise the they will provoke a warning that the value is being
ignored.

@section multibody_parsing_drake_extensions Drake Extensions

Drake extends both SDFormat and URDF in similar ways, to allow access to
Drake-specific features. This section provides a compact reference to all
Drake extensions and their use in both formats.

Note that in both formats, it is proper to declare the `drake:` namespace
prefix. For SDFormat, declare it like this:

    <sdf xmlns:drake="http://drake.mit.edu" version="1.9">

For URDF, declare the namespace prefix like this:

    <robot xmlns:drake="http://drake.mit.edu" name="test_robot">

- Syntax: One floating point value, non-negative.

@subsubsection tag_drake_acceleration_semantics Semantics

If the joint type is one of (continuous, prismatic, revolute), specifies
acceleration limits of (-VALUE, +VALUE). Units are determined by the type of
joint, either radians/sec^2 for continuous and revolute joints, or m/s^2 for
prismatic joints.

@subsection tag_drake_accepting_renderer drake:accepting_renderer

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/visual/drake:accepting_renderer`
- URDF path: `/robot/link/visual/drake:accepting_renderer/@name`
- Syntax: String.

@subsubsection tag_drake_accepting_renderer_semantics Semantics

The tag serves as a list of renderers for which this visual is targeted.

  - The _value_ of the tag is the name of the renderer.
  - If the _value_ is empty, that is a parsing error.
  - If no instance of `<drake:accepting_renderer>` every renderer will be given
    the chance to reify this visual geometry.
  - Multiple instances of this tag are allowed. Each instance adds a renderer to
    the list of targeted renderers.

This feature is one way to provide multiple visual representations of a body.

Specifying this tag for a visual whose perception role has been disabled will
emit a warning.

SDFormat note: `drake:capsule` is proposed for deprecation; see
[issue #14387](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/14837).

URDF note: Drake supports both `drake:capsule`, and a non-standard

@subsubsection tag_drake_circular_arc_semantics Semantics

A joint-type-specific tag for drake::multibody::CurvilinearJoint, corresponding to a
`drake:joint` of `curvilinear` type.

This element specifies a circular arc along which the joint moves. The initial position
and orientation of the segment are defined by the `drake:initial_tangent` and `drake:plane_normal`
tags on the joint and previous segments in the joint's `drake:curves` list.

The circular arc rotates about the plane normal axis, with a turning angle and radius specified directly
in the tag by right hand rule.

For URDF, these values are contained in the `radius` and `angle` attributes of the element.
For SDF, `drake:radius` and `drake:angle` child elements contain the values.

@see @ref tag_drake_curves, @ref tag_drake_initial_tangent, @ref tag_drake_plane_normal,
@ref tag_drake_radius, @ref tag_drake_angle

@subsection tag_drake_collision_filter_group drake:collision_filter_group

- SDFormat path: `//model/drake:collision_filter_group`
- URDF path: `/robot/drake:collision_filter_group`
- Syntax: Attributes `name` (string) and `ignore` (boolean); nested elements
          `drake:member`, `drake:member_group`, and
          `drake:ignored_collision_filter_group`.

@subsubsection tag_drake_collision_filter_group_semantics Semantics

This element names a group of bodies to participate in collision filtering
rules. If the `ignore` attribute is present and true-valued, the entire element
is skipped during parsing. The nested elements must included one or more
`drake:member` or `drake:member_group` elements, and zero or more
`drake:ignored_collision_filter_group` elements.

This element defines a new group name that is only available during parsing. It
must not be a scoped name.

Collision filtering rules are only constructed with **pairs** of groups, where
both sides of the pair may name the same group. The
`drake:ignored_collision_filter_group` element establishes a pairing between
the group it names and the group within which it is nested. A pair containing
different collision groups excludes collisions between members of those groups
(see drake::geometry::CollisionFilterDeclaration::ExcludeBetween()). A pair
naming the same group twice excludes collisions within the group (see
drake::geometry::CollisionFilterDeclaration::ExcludeWithin()).

@see @ref tag_drake_member, @ref tag_drake_member_group, @ref tag_drake_ignored_collision_filter_group, @ref scoped_names

@subsection tag_drake_compliant_hydroelastic drake:compliant_hydroelastic

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/collision/drake:proximity_properties/drake:compliant_hydroelastic`
- URDF path: `/robot/link/collision/drake:proximity_properties/drake:compliant_hydroelastic`
- Syntax: Empty element.

@subsubsection tag_drake_compliant_hydroelastic_semantics Semantics

If present, this element sets the compliance type of the element being defined
to be compliant, as opposed to rigid, in hydroelastic contact models.

@see @ref tag_drake_proximity_properties, @ref creating_hydro_reps

@subsection tag_drake_controller_gains drake:controller_gains

- SDFormat path: `//model/joint/drake:controller_gains`
- URDF path: `/robot/joint/actuator/drake:controller_gains`
- Syntax: Two attributes `p` (proportional gain) containing a positive floating
          point value and `d` (derivative gain) containing a non-negative
          floating point value.

@subsection tag_drake_controller_gains_semantics Semantics

If present, this element provides proportional and derivative gains for a low
level PD controller for the drake::multibody::JointActuator associated with the
drake::multibody::Joint the element is defined under. It is stored in a
drake::multibody::PdControllerGains object in the
drake::multibody::JointActuator class. Both attributes `p` and `d` are required.

@see @ref mbp_actuation, @ref pd_controlled_joint_actuator

@subsection tag_drake_curves drake:curves

- SDFormat path: `//model/drake:joint/drake:curves`
- URDF path: `/robot/drake:joint/drake:curves`
- Syntax: List of `drake:line_segment` and `drake:circular_arc` child elements.

@subsubsection tag_drake_curves_semantics Semantics

A joint-type-specific tag for drake::multibody::CurvilinearJoint, corresponding to a
`drake:joint` of `curvilinear` type.

Curvilinear joints allow the child frame to move relative to the parent along a
planar curvilinear path, expressed in this tag as an ordered list of linear
and circular arc segments. Each segment is appended to the end of the previous

@subsubsection tag_drake_damping_semantics Semantics

If the parent joint type is planar, construct a vector from the values (units
of (N⋅s/m, N⋅s/m, N⋅m⋅s) respectively) and pass it to the `damping` parameter
of the constructor of drake::multibody::PlanarJoint. The first two values are
for translation; the third is for rotation. See that class for discussion of
units and detailed semantics.

URDF Note: The comparable feature in URDF is the standard
`/robot/joint/dynamics/@damping` attribute.

@subsection tag_drake_deformable_properties drake:deformable_properties

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/drake:deformable_properties`
- URDF path: n/a
- Syntax: Nested elements; see below.

@subsubsection tag_drake_deformable_properties Semantics

If present, this element defines the link element as a deformable body in Drake.
Such link elements are not treated as rigid bodies, and the standard tags such as
inertia are illegal and provoke errors. The only other tags that
are allowed are under such "deformable" links are `<pose>`, `<collision>`, and
`<visual>`. Attaching frames, joints, and other elements to deformable links is
not allowed. The `<pose>` tag is interpreted as the pose of the deformable geometry
used for dynamics and collision in its reference configuration. The `<collision>`
and `<visual>` tags are *not* interpreted exactly the same way as the standard
`<collision>` and `<visual>` tags either. We explain the differences in the
@ref tag_deformable_link_requirements section.

The following nested elements may be present under `<drake:deformable_properties>`:
- `drake:youngs_modulus`
- `drake:poissons_ratio`
- `drake:mass_damping`
- `drake:stiffness_damping`
- `drake:mass_density`

If present, this element indicates (by filename or `package:` URI) a PNG file
to use as a diffuse texture map. The resolved path name is stored in a
PerceptionProperties object under `(phong, diffuse_map)`. URDF provides a
built-in tag, i.e., `//robot/material/texture` or

@subsubsection tag_drake_ignored_collision_filter_group_semantics Semantics

The string names a collision filter group that will be paired with the parent
group when constructing filtering rules. It may name the parent group.

In SDFormat files only, the name may refer to a group within a nested model
(either URDF or SDFormat) by using a scoped name.

@subsection tag_drake_illustration_properties drake:illustration_properties

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/visual/drake:illustration_properties`
- URDF path: n/a
- Syntax: Single attribute: `enabled` (bool).

@subsubsection tag_drake_illustration_properties_semantics Semantics

`<visual>` geometries are assigned illustration roles by default. Their
appearance in visualizers reflect the materials associated with the `<visual>`
tag (or, as for meshes, the materials associated with the mesh). If no materials
are defined, then they pick up whatever default materials the visualizers
define. A `<visual>` tag can _opt out_ of the illustration role by setting the
`enabled` attribute to `false`. Setting it to `true` is equivalent to omitting
the tag completely.

Note: if a `<visual>` tag has disabled both illustration properties _and_
perception properties, a warning will be emitted. Essentially, the model
defines a geometry that would be consumed by typical loaders, but it has been
completely disabled for Drake. The definition for Drake should _refine_ the more
generic model, but it shouldn't consist of an arbitrarily different set of
visuals.

@subsubsection tag_drake_initial_tangent_semantics Semantics

A joint-type-specific tag for drake::multibody::CurvilinearJoint, corresponding to a
`drake:joint` of `curvilinear` type.

For curvilinear joints, this element provides the tangent vector, in parent frame coordinates,
of the curvilinear path along which the joint moves at joint position `0`.

- URDF path: `/robot/drake:joint/drake:is_periodic/@value`
- Syntax: Boolean value, `true` or `false`, expressed

@subsubsection tag_drake_is_periodic_semantics Semantics

A joint-type-specific tag for drake::multibody::CurvilinearJoint, corresponding to a
`drake:joint` of `curvilinear` type.

Curvilinear joints can be periodic, allowing the joint to travel multiple laps along the
curvilinear path of the joint without hitting joint limits. This element specifies whether
this behavior is enabled (`true`) or not.

For SDF, the value `true` or `false` is specified as the content of the tag.
For URDF, the value is expressed as the `value` attribute of the tag.

@see @ref tag_drake_joint

@subsection tag_drake_joint drake:joint

- SDFormat path: `//model/drake:joint`
- URDF path: `/robot/drake:joint`
- Syntax: Attributes `name` (string) and `type` (choice: see below), and nested
          elements (see below).

@subsubsection tag_drake_joint_semantics Semantics

In both formats, the drake:joint element is used as a substitute for standard
joint elements, to allow support for non-standard joint types. The overall
semantics are the same as for a standard joint.

In SDFormat, the supported `type` values are `curvilinear` and `planar`. The element must
contain nested `drake:parent`, `drake:child`, and `drake:damping` elements.

In URDF, supported `type` values are one of `ball`, `curvilinear`, `planar`, `screw` or
`universal`. The nested elements are the same as those defined by the standard
joint element with the exception of the `screw` and `curvilinear` joint types. `screw`
joints requires a nested `drake:screw_thread_pitch` element. `curvilinear` joints
require a full geometric definition of a planar curvilinear path along which the
joint moves, specified as the following:
- `drake:plane_normal`: A normal vector for the plane expressed in parent frame.
- `drake:initial_tangent`: A tangent vector for the curvilinear path at joint position `0`,
  expressed in parent frame.
- `drake:curves`: A list of line segments and circular arcs defining the curve shape.
- `drake:is_periodic`: A boolean value specifying whether the curve is periodic, allowing
  the joint to traverse multiple laps of the curve without hitting joint limits.

- URDF path: `/robot/drake:joint/drake:curves/drake:line_segment`
- Syntax: length in meters, expressed as a single floating point value
  in attribute `length` for URDF and in a `drake:length` child element for SDF.

@subsubsection tag_drake_line_segment_semantics Semantics

A joint-type-specific tag for drake::multibody::CurvilinearJoint, corresponding to a
`drake:joint` of `curvilinear` type.

This element specifies a line segment along which the joint moves. The initial position
and orientation of the segment are defined by the `drake:initial_tangent` and `drake:plane_normal`
tags on the joint and previous segments in the joint's `drake:curves` list.

The length of the segment is expressed in the tag directly. For URDF, this value is contained
in the `length` attribute of the element, while for SDF, this value is contained in a `drake:length`
child element.

- Syntax: A positive floating point value.

@subsubsection tag_drake_mesh_resolution_hint_semantics Semantics

The provided value (in units of meters) helps select the resolution of meshes
generated from geometric primitives (sphere, cylinder, capsule, etc.). The
exact semantics depend on the geometry being generated. Within some practical
limits, smaller values will select shorter edge lengths and a finer mesh, larger
values will select longer edge lengths and a coarser mesh.

@subsection tag_drake_mimic drake:mimic

- SDFormat path: `//model/joint/drake:mimic`
- URDF path: unsupported
- Syntax: Attributes `joint` (string), `multiplier` (double) and `offset` (double)

@subsubsection tag_drake_mimic_semantics Semantics

This tag has equivalent semantics to those of the native URDF <mimic> tag. If
`q0` is the position of the `<joint>` and `q1` the position of the joint
specified by the `joint` attribute, the two joints are constrained to enforce
the relation: `q0 = multiplier * q1 + offset`. The units of `multiplier` and
`offset` depend on the type of joints specified. This tag only supports single
degree of freedom joints that exist in the same model instance.

- SDFormat path: `//model/link/visual/drake:perception_properties`
- URDF path: n/a
- Syntax: Single attribute: `enabled` (bool).

@subsubsection tag_drake_perception_properties_semantics Semantics

`<visual>` geometries are assigned perception roles by default. Their appearance
in renderers reflect the materials associated with the `<visual>` tag (or, as
for meshes, the materials associated with the mesh). If no materials are
defined, then they pick up whatever default materials the renderers define. A
`<visual>` tag can _opt out_ of the perception role by setting the `enabled`
attribute to `false`. Setting it to `true` is equivalent to omitting the tag
completely.

Note: if a `<visual>` tag has disabled both perception properties _and_
illustration properties, a warning will be emitted. Essentially, the model
defines a geometry that would be consumed by typical loaders, but it has been
completely disabled for Drake. The definition for Drake should _refine_ the more
generic model, but it shouldn't consist of an arbitrarily different set of
visuals.

@subsection tag_drake_visual drake:visual

- SDFormat path: `//model/link`
- URDF path: n/a
- Syntax: Identical to SDFormat's `<visual>` tag, but with the `drake` namespace
  prepended. All tags that can be found under the `<visual>` tag (e.g.,
  `<pose>`, `<geometry>`, `<sphere>`, etc.) can be included under the
  `<drake:visual>` tag, provided they have the `drake` namespace affixed (e.g.,
  `<drake:pose>`, `<drake:geometry>`, `<drake:sphere>`, etc.).

@subsubsection tag_drake_visual_semantics Semantics

The `<drake:visual>` tag is provided for the purpose of defining visual elements
that only Drake will consume. This could be used to do Drake-specific
augmentation of a model. But the main intended use case is for associating
_different_ geometries with a link based on its role. Use one geometry for the
illustration role and another for the perception role. To use different
geometries per role:

  1. Choose the illustration and perception geometries.
  2. Decide which geometry you want to serve as the default geometry in other
     SDFormat loaders.
  3. Use the SDFormat `<visual>` tag for that default geometry (including all
     typical descendant tags).
  4. In the `<visual>` tag, include the `<drake:??_properties>` tag of the
     role this visual should *not* serve. Set its `enabled` attribute to
     `false`. Remember, by default the visual would get both roles, so you have
     to opt out of the role you don't want the geometry to have.
  5. As a sibling to that main `<visual>`, add a `<drake:visual>` tag and define
     its subtree as you normally would (making sure to prefix everything with
     the `drake:` namespace).
  6. Under the `<drake:visual>` tag, include the _other_ `<drake:??_properties>`
     tag and set its `enabled` tag to `false`.

This will allow Drake to use different visual representations for each visual
role but still keep a more general SDFormat definition for other loaders.

Note: disabling both visual roles on a `<drake:visual>` element will _not_
emit a warning as it would for doing the same to a `<visual>` tag.
