# This file shows that we are able to inject frames into included models using
# ModelDirectives. This workflow allows users to posture and/or weld other
# models onto injected frames that would be relative to a nested model.
# For example, injecting a frame onto a robot arm model's gripper, and welding
# a newly included tool model onto it for the robot to use.

directives:

# Top level model, for example the robot arm.
- add_model:
    name: top_level_model
    file: package://process_model_directives_test/simple_model.sdf

# Injecting a frame from the world level into top_level_model, for example the
# gripper of the robot arm.
- add_frame:
    name: top_injected_frame
    X_PF:
      base_frame: top_level_model::base
      translation: [1, 2, 3]

# Including a new model, for example a new tool.
- add_model:
    name: mid_level_model
    file: package://process_model_directives_test/simple_model.sdf

# Welding the newly included tool to top_injected_frame, from the world level.
- add_weld:
    parent: top_injected_frame
    child: mid_level_model::base

# Repeat the steps for another level lower.
- add_frame:
    name: mid_injected_frame
    X_PF:
      base_frame: mid_level_model::base
      translation: [1, 2, 3]
- add_model:
    name: bottom_level_model
    file: package://process_model_directives_test/simple_model.sdf
- add_weld:
    parent: mid_injected_frame
    child: bottom_level_model::base
