      Explicitly resolving a frame by namespacing its name is not supported
      and not needed, hence they will be commented out.

      TODO(aaronchongth): Without this feature, there may be existing workflows
      that are impacted and will need adjustment. For example, adding
      "left::arm::gripper_origin" from a top level include, and then leveraging
      this new model scope for other operations just scoped within "left::".
