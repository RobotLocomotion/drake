# The trio of `add_scoped_*.yaml` files are a test yaml structure that uses
# each feature of the model directives system.  This file is the middle level
# of a three-file inclusion hierarcy of model directives, and is also used as
# a smoke test of the inclusion mechanism.

directives:
- add_model_instance:
    name: nested
- add_frame:
    name: nested::simple_model_origin
