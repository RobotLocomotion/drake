/// SDFormat files may contain multiple `<model>` elements.  New model
/// instances will be added to @p plant for each `<model>` tag in the file.
///
/// @note Adding multiple root-level models, i.e, `<model>`s directly under
/// `<sdf>`, is deprecated. If you need multiple models in a single file,
/// please use an SDFormat world tag.
///
/// URDF files contain a single `<robot>` element.  Only a single model
/// instance will be added to @p plant.
///
/// MJCF (MuJoCo XML) files typically contain many bodies, they will all be
/// added as a single model instance in the @p plant.
///
/// Drake Model Directives are only available via AddModels or
/// AddModelsFromString. The single-model methods (AddModelFromFile,
/// AddModelFromString) cannot load model directives.
///
/// OBJ files will infer a model with a single body from the geometry. The OBJ
/// file must contain a _single_ object (in the OBJ-file sense). The body's mass
/// properties are computed based on uniform distribution of material in the
/// enclosed volume of the mesh (with the approximate density of water: 1000
/// kg/mÂ³). If the mesh is not a closed manifold, this can produce unexpected
/// results. The spatial inertia of the body is measured at the body frame's
/// origin. The body's frame is coincident and fixed with the frame the mesh's
/// vertices are measured and expressed in. The mesh's vertices are assumed to
/// be measured in units of _meters_.
///
/// The name of the model and body are determined according to the following
/// prioritized protocol:
///
///   - The non-empty `model_name`, if given (e.g., in AddModelFromFile()).
///   - If the object is named in the obj file, that object name is used.
///   - Otherwise, the base name of the file name is used (i.e., the file name
///     with the prefixed directory and extension removed).
///
/// If the underlying plant is registered with a SceneGraph instance, the mesh
/// will also be used for all three roles: illustration, perception, and
/// proximity.
///
/// @warning AddModelsFromString() cannot be passed OBJ file contents yet.
///
/// For more documentation of Drake-specific treatment of these input formats,
/// see @ref multibody_parsing.
///
/// When parsing literal quantities, %Parser assumes SI units and radians in the
/// absence of units specified by the format itself. This includes the literals
/// in the explicitly specified files as well as referenced files such as OBJ
/// or other data file formats.
///
/// MultibodyPlant requires that model instances have unique names. To support
/// loading multiple instances of the same model file(s) into a plant, Parser
/// offers a few different strategies.
///
/// Parser has constructors that take a model name prefix, which gets applied to
/// all models loaded with that Parser instance. The resulting workflow makes
/// multiple parsers to build models for a single plant:
/// @code
///  Parser left_parser(plant, "left");
///  Parser right_parser(plant, "right");
///  left_parser.AddModels(arm_model);  // "left::arm"
///  right_parser.AddModels(arm_model);  // "right::arm"
///  left_parser.AddModels(gripper_model);  // "left::gripper"
///  right_parser.AddModels(gripper_model);  // "right::gripper"
/// @endcode
///
/// For situations where it is convenient to load a model many times, Parser
/// offers optional auto-renaming. When auto-renaming is enabled, name
/// collisions will be resolved by adding a subscript to the name.
/// @code
///  Parser parser(plant);
///  parser.SetAutoRenaming(true);
///  // Subscripts are compact, and start at 1.
///  parser.AddModels(rock);  // "rock"
///  parser.AddModels(rock);  // "rock_1"
///  parser.AddModels(rock);  // "rock_2"
///  // Subscripts of different base names are independent.
///  parser.AddModels(stone);  // "stone"
///  parser.AddModels(stone);  // "stone_1"
///  parser.AddModels(stone);  // "stone_2"
/// @endcode
///
/// (Advanced) In the rare case where the user is parsing into a MultibodyPlant
/// and SceneGraph but has created them one at a time instead of using the more
/// convenient AddMultibodyPlant() or AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph() functions,
/// the Parser constructors accept an optional SceneGraph pointer to specify
/// which SceneGraph to parse into. If it is provided and non-null and the
/// MultibodyPlant is not registered as a source, the Parser will perform the
/// SceneGraph registration into the given plant. We describe this option only
/// for completeness; we strongly discourage anyone from taking advantage of
/// this feature.
