/// This %ForceElement models a spring-damper attached between two points on
/// two different bodies.
/// Given a point P on a body A and a point Q on a body B with positions
/// p_AP and p_BQ, respectively, this spring-damper applies equal and
/// opposite forces on bodies A and B according to: <pre>
///   f_AP = (k⋅(ℓ - ℓ₀) + c⋅dℓ/dt)⋅r̂
///   f_BQ = -f_AP
/// </pre>
/// where `ℓ = ‖p_WQ - p_WP‖` is the current length of the spring, dℓ/dt its
/// rate of change, `r̂ = (p_WQ - p_WP) / ℓ` is the normalized vector from P to
/// Q, ℓ₀ is the free length of the spring and k and c are the stiffness and
/// damping of the spring-damper, respectively. This ForceElement is meant to
/// model finite free length springs attached between two points. In this
/// typical arrangement springs are usually pre-loaded, meaning they apply
/// a non-zero spring force in the static configuration of the system. Thus,
/// neither the free length ℓ₀ nor the current length ℓ of the spring can ever
/// be zero. The length of the spring approaching zero would incur in a
/// non-physical configuration and therefore this element throws a
/// std::runtime_error exception in that case.
/// Note that:
///
///   - The applied force is always along the line connecting points P and Q.
///   - Damping always dissipates energy.
///   - Forces on bodies A and B are equal and opposite according to Newton's
///     third law.
///
/// @tparam T The scalar type. Must be a valid Eigen scalar.
///
/// Instantiated templates for the following kinds of T's are provided:
///
/// - double
/// - AutoDiffXd
///
/// They are already available to link against in the containing library.
/// No other values for T are currently supported.
