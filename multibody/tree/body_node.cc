  // N.B. This code is tested in two ways:
  //  - body_node_test.cc: test the precision of the throwing condition based on
  //    the given hinge matrix, D_B. I.e., is this "correct"?
  //  - multibody_plant_forward_dynamics_test.cc: test integration with the
  //    larger multibody ecosystem (see the TestHingeInertiaMatrix fixture) to
  //    confirm that bad models/configurations get caught in this net. In
  //    other words, does this test serve its intended purpose?

  // Compute the LLT factorization of D_B as llt_D_B.
  // Note: Eigen benchmarks for various matrix factorizations are here:
  // https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__DenseDecompositionBenchmark.html
  // As compared to factoring with LLT, the benchmark (as of October 2022)
  // reports other methods of factoring small 8x8 matrices are slower by:
  // LDLT 1.3x, PartialPivLU 1.5x, FullPivLU = 1.9x, HouseholderQR 3.5x,
  // CompleteOrthogonalDecomposition 4.3x, FullPivHouseholderQR 4.3x,
  // JacobiSVD 18.6x, BDCSVD 19.7x.

      MatrixUpTo6<T>(D_B.template selfadjointView<Eigen::Lower>()));

  // Ensure D_B (the articulated body hinge inertia matrix) is positive definite
  // (which means that all its eigenvalues are positive). If it is not positive
  // definite, the matrix may be non-physical, e.g., it has a zero moment of
  // inertia for an axis about which rotation is permitted.
  // Example: The 1x1 hinge matrix D_B = [3.3] is positive definite whereas
  // D_B = [0] or D_B = [-1E-22] are not positive definite.
  // If factorization fails, throw an assertion.
  // TODO(Mitiguy) Improve robustness of the test for a positive definite D_B.
  //  LLT factorization is not a reliable test of near-singular matrices.
  //  If LLT fails, we _know_ that D_B is not reliably positive-definite.
  //  However, if LLT succeeds, D_B may be near-singular. It would be ideal to
  //  have a fast check for near-singular cases. One mathematically rigorous
  //  technique that was tested was to do a 2ⁿᵈ LLT factorization on (D_B - ε I)
  //  where ε is a prudently chosen small number and I is the identity matrix.
  //  If the LLT of (D_B - ε I) is not positive definite and the LLT of D_B is
  //  positive definite, we _know_ D_B is near singular.
