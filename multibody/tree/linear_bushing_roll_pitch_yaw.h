/// ### Advanced: More on how to choose bushing stiffness and damping constants.
/// The basics on how to choose bushing stiffness and damping constants are at:
/// - @ref Basic_bushing_torque_stiffness_and_damping
///        "How to choose torque stiffness and damping constants"
/// - @ref Basic_bushing_force_stiffness_and_damping
///        "How to choose force stiffness and damping constants"
///
/// The list below provides more detail on: The performance tradeoff between
/// high stiffness and long simulation time; loads that affect estimates of
/// Mxₘₐₓ or Fxₘₐₓ; and how a linear 2ⁿᵈ-order ODE provides insight on how to
/// experimentally determine stiffness and damping constants.
/// - Stiffness [k₀ k₁ k₂] and [kx ky kz] affect simulation time and accuracy.
/// Generally, a stiffer bushing better resembles an ideal joint (e.g., a
/// revolute joint or fixed/weld joint).  However (depending on integrator), a
/// stiffer bushing usually increases numerical integration time.
/// - An estimate for a maximum load Mxₘₐₓ or Fxₘₐₓ accounts for gravity forces,
/// applied forces, inertia forces (centripetal, Coriolis, gyroscopic), etc.
/// - One way to determine physical stiffness and damping constants is through
/// the mathematical intermediaries ωₙ (units of rad/s) and ζ (no units).
/// The constant ωₙ (called "undamped natural frequency" or "angular frequency")
/// and constant ζ (called "damping ratio") relate to the physical constants
/// mass m, damping constant dx, and stiffness constant kx via the following
/// prototypical linear constant-coefficient 2ⁿᵈ-order ODEs. <pre>
///  m ẍ +     dx ẋ +  kx x = 0   or alternatively as
///    ẍ + 2 ζ ωₙ ẋ + ωₙ² x = 0   where ωₙ² = kx/m,  ζ = dx / (2 √(m kx))</pre>
/// ωₙ and ζ also appear in the related ODEs for rotational systems, namely<pre>
///  I₀ q̈ +     d₀ q̇ +  k₀ q = 0   or alternatively as
///     q̈ + 2 ζ ωₙ q̇ + ωₙ² q = 0   where ωₙ² = k₀/I₀,  ζ = d₀ / (2 √(I₀ k₀))
/// </pre>
/// One way to determine ωₙ is from settling time tₛ which approximates the
///  time for a system to settle to within a specified settling ratio of an
///  equilibrium solutions.  Typical values for settling ratio are 1% (0.01),
///  2% (0.02), 5% (0.05), and 10% (0.10).
///  - When ζ < 0.7 (underdamped), a commonly used approximation is
///    ωₙ ≈ -ln(settling_ratio) / (ζ tₛ) which for settling ratios 0.01 and 0.05
///    give ωₙ ≈ 4.6 / (ζ tₛ) and ωₙ ≈ 3 / (ζ tₛ).  Another commonly used
///    approximation is ωₙ ≈ -ln(settling_ratio √(1- ζ²)) / (ζ tₛ).
///    See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settling_time or the book
///    Modern Control Engineering by Katsuhiko Ogata. Although these approximate
///    formulas for ωₙ are common, they are somewhat inaccurate.  Settling time
///    for underdamped systems is discontinuous and requires solving a nonlinear
///    algebraic equation (an iterative process).  For more information, see
///    http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rfiua/n66/n66a09.pdf

///    second order systems: a photovoltaic application".  Another reference is
///    https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece486/sp2020/laboratory/docs/lab2/estimates.html
///  - When ζ ≈ 1 (critically damped), ωₙ is determined by choosing a settling
///    ratio and then solving for (ωₙ tₛ) via the nonlinear algebraic equation
///    (1 + ωₙ tₛ)*exp(-ωₙ tₛ) = settling_ratio.

/// ### Derivation: Approximate formula for overdamped settling time.
/// Since a literature reference for this formula was not found, the derivation
/// below was done at TRI (it has not been peer reviewed). This formula results
/// from the "dominant pole" solution in the prototypical constant-coefficient
/// linear 2ⁿᵈ-order ODE.  For ẋ(0) = 0, mathematics shows poles p₁ = -ωₙ s₁,
/// p₂ = -ωₙ s₂, where sz = √(ζ² - 1), s₁ = ζ - sz, s₂ = ζ + sz. and <pre>
///  x(t) / x(0) = p₂/(p₂-p₁) exp(p₁ t) - p₁/(p₂-p₁) exp(p₂ t)
///              = s₂/(s₂-s₁) exp(p₁ t) - s₁/(s₂-s₁) exp(p₂ t)
///              =  k/( k-1 ) exp(p₁ t) -  1/( k-1 ) exp(p₂ t) where k = s₂ / s₁
///              ≈  k/( k-1 ) exp(p₁ t)                        since p₁ > p₂
/// </pre>
/// Note: k = s₂ / s₁ is real, k > 0, s₂ = k s₁, and p₁ > p₂ (p₁ is less
/// negative then p₂), so exp(p₁ t) decays to zero slower than exp(p₂ t) and
/// exp(p₁ t) ≫ exp(p₂ t) for sufficiently large t.  Hence we assume
/// exp(p₂ t) ≈ 0 (which is why p₁ is called the "dominant pole").  Next, <pre>
///   k/(k - 1) = s₂ / s₁ / (s₂/s₁ -1) = s₂ / (s₂ - s₁) = s₂ / (2 sz),  so
///   x(t) / x(0)  ≈  s₂ / (2 sz) exp(-s₁ ωₙ t),                        hence
///   settling_ratio ≈ s₂ / (2 sz) exp(-s₁ ωₙ tₛ),                      finally
///   ωₙ ≈ -ln(settling_ratio 2 sz / s₂) / (s₁ tₛ)
/// </pre>
