/// This class represents the physical concept of a _Spatial Inertia_. A
/// spatial inertia (or spatial mass matrix) encapsulates the mass, center of
/// mass, and rotational inertia of the mass distribution of a body or composite
/// body S, where with "composite body" we mean a collection of bodies welded
/// together containing at least one body (throughout this documentation "body"
/// is many times used instead of "composite body" but the same concepts apply
/// to a collection of bodies as well.)
/// A spatial inertia is an element of ℝ⁶ˣ⁶ that is symmetric, and positive
/// semi-definite. It logically consists of `3x3` sub-matrices arranged like
/// so, [Jain 2010]:
/// <pre>
///              Spatial mass matrix
///           ------------ ------------
///        0 |            |            |
///        1 |    I_SP    | m p_PScm×  |
///        2 |            |            |
///           ------------ ------------
///        3 |            |            |
///        4 | -m p_PScm× |     m Id   |
///        5 |            |            |
///           ------------ ------------
///                Symbol: M
/// </pre>
/// where, with the monogram notation described in
/// @ref multibody_spatial_inertia, `I_SP` is the rotational inertia of body or
/// composite body S computed about a point P, m is the mass of this composite
/// body, `p_PScm` is the position vector from point P to the center of mass
/// `Scm` of the composite body S with `p_PScm×` denoting its skew-symmetric
/// cross product matrix (defined such that `a× b = a.cross(b)`), and `Id` is
/// the identity matrix in ℝ³ˣ³. See Section 2.1, p. 17 of [Jain 2010].
/// The logical arrangement as shown above is chosen to be consistent with our
/// logical arrangement for spatial vectors as documented in
/// @ref multibody_spatial_algebra for which the rotational component comes
/// first followed by the translational component.
///
/// In typeset material we use the symbol @f$ [M^{S/P}]_E @f$ to represent the
/// spatial inertia of a body or composite body S about point P, expressed in
/// frame E. For this inertia, the monogram notation reads `M_SP_E`. If the
/// point P is fixed to a body B, we write that point as @f$ B_P @f$ which
/// appears in code and comments as `Bp`. So if the body or composite body is B
/// and the about point is `Bp`, the monogram notation reads `M_BBp_E`, which
/// can be abbreviated to `M_Bp_E` since the about point `Bp` also identifies
/// the body. Common cases are that the about point is the origin `Bo` of the
/// body, or it's the center of mass `Bcm` for which the rotational inertia in
/// monogram notation would read as `I_Bo_E` and `I_Bcm_E`, respectively.
/// Given `M_BP_E` (@f$[M^{B/P}]_E@f$), the rotational inertia of this spatial
/// inertia is `I_BP_E` (@f$[I^{B/P}]_E@f$) and the position vector of the
/// center of mass measured from point P and expressed in E is `p_PBcm_E`
/// (@f$[^Pp^{B_{cm}}]_E@f$).
///
/// @note This class does not implement any mechanism to track the frame E in
/// which a spatial inertia is expressed or about what point is computed.
/// Methods and operators on this class have no means to determine frame
/// consistency through operations. It is therefore the responsibility of users
/// of this class to keep track of frames in which operations are performed. We
/// suggest doing that using disciplined notation, as described above.
///
/// @note Several methods in this class throw a std::exception for invalid
/// rotational inertia operations in debug releases only.  This provides speed
/// in a release build while facilitating debugging in debug builds.
/// In addition, these validity tests are only performed for scalar types for
/// which drake::scalar_predicate<T>::is_bool is `true`. For instance, validity
/// checks are not performed when T is symbolic::Expression.
///
/// @note The methods of this class satisfy the "basic exception guarantee": if
/// an exception is thrown, the program will still be in a valid
/// state. Specifically, no resources are leaked, and all objects' invariants
/// are intact. Be aware that SpatialInertia objects may contain invalid
/// inertia data in cases where input checking is skipped.
