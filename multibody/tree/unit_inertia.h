/// This class is used to represent rotational inertias for unit mass bodies.
/// Therefore, unlike RotationalInertia whose units are kg⋅m², the units of a
/// %UnitInertia are those of length squared. A unit inertia is a useful concept
/// to represent the geometric distribution of mass in a body regardless of the
/// actual value of the body mass. The rotational inertia of a body can
/// therefore be obtained by multiplying its unit inertia by its mass.
/// Unit inertia matrices can also be called **gyration** matrices and therefore
/// we choose to represent them in source code notation with the capital letter
/// G. In contrast, the capital letter I is used to represent non-unit
/// mass rotational inertias.
/// This class restricts the set of allowed operations on a unit inertia to
/// ensure the unit-mass invariant. For instance, multiplication by a scalar can
/// only return a general RotationalInertia but not a %UnitInertia.
///
/// @note This class has no means to check at construction from user provided
/// parameters whether it actually represents the unit inertia or gyration
/// matrix of a unit-mass body. However, as previously noted, once a unit
/// inertia is created, a number of operations are disallowed to ensure the
/// unit-mass invariant.
/// Also notice that once a unit inertia is created, it _is_ the unit inertia
/// of _some_ body, perhaps with scaled geometry from the user's intention.
