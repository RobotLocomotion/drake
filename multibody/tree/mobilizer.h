/// %Mobilizer is a fundamental object within Drake's multibody engine used to
/// specify the allowed motions between two Frame objects within a
/// MultibodyTree. Specifying the allowed motions between two Frame objects
/// effectively also specifies a kinematic relationship between the two bodies
/// associated with those two frames. Consider the following example to build a
/// simple pendulum system:
///
/// @code
/// MultibodyTree<double> model;
/// // ... Code here to setup quantities below as mass, com, X_BP, etc. ...
/// const Body<double>& pendulum =
///   model.AddBody<RigidBody>(SpatialInertia<double>(mass, com, unit_inertia));
/// // We will connect the pendulum body to the world frame using a
/// // RevoluteMobilizer. To do so we define a pin frame P rigidly attached to
/// // the pendulum body.
/// FixedOffsetFrame<double>& pin_frame =
///   model.AddFrame<FixedOffsetFrame>(
///     pendulum.body_frame(),
///     X_BP /* pose of pin frame P in body frame B */);
/// // The mobilizer connects the world frame and the pin frame effectively
/// // adding the single degree of freedom describing this system. In this
/// // regard, the the role of a mobilizer is equivalent but conceptually
/// // different than a set of constraints that effectively remove all degrees
/// // of freedom but the one permitting rotation about the z-axis.
/// const RevoluteMobilizer<double>& revolute_mobilizer =
///   model.AddMobilizer<RevoluteMobilizer>(
///     model.world_frame(), /* inboard frame */

///
/// <h3>Tree Structure</h3>
///
/// A %Mobilizer induces a tree structure within a MultibodyTree
/// model, connecting an inboard (topologically closer to the world) frame to an
/// outboard (topologically further from the world) frame. Every time a
/// %Mobilizer is added to a MultibodyTree (using the
/// MultibodyTree::AddMobilizer() method), a number of degrees of
/// freedom associated with the particular type of %Mobilizer are added to the
/// multibody system. In the example above for the single pendulum, adding a
/// RevoluteMobilizer has two purposes:
///
/// - It defines the tree structure of the model. World is the inboard body
///   while "pendulum" is the outboard body in the MultibodyTree.
/// - It informs the MultibodyTree of the degrees of freedom granted by the
///   revolute mobilizer between the two frames it connects.
/// - It defines a permissible motion space spanned by the generalized
///   coordinates introduced by the mobilizer.
///
/// <h3>Mathematical Description of a %Mobilizer</h3>
///
/// A %Mobilizer describes the kinematics relationship between an inboard frame
/// F and an outboard frame M, introducing an nq-dimensional vector of
/// generalized coordinates q and an nv-dimensional vector of generalized
/// velocities v. Notice that in general `nq != nv`, though `nq == nv` is a very
/// common case. The kinematic relationships introduced by a %Mobilizer are
/// fully specified by, [Seth 2010]. The monogram notation used below for X_FM,
/// V_FM, F_Mo_F, etc., are described in @ref multibody_frames_and_bodies.
///
/// - X_FM(q):
///     The outboard frame M's pose as measured and expressed in the inboard
///     frame F, as a function of the mobilizer's generalized positions `q`.
///     This pose is computed by CalcAcrossMobilizerTransform().
/// - H_FM(q):
///     The `6 x nv` mobilizer hinge matrix `H_FM` relates `V_FM` (outboard
///     frame M's spatial velocity in its inboard frame F, expressed in F) to
///     the mobilizer's `nv` generalized velocities (or mobilities) `v` as
///     `V_FM = H_FM * v`.  The method CalcAcrossMobilizerSpatialVelocity()
///     calculates `V_FM`.  Be aware that Drake's spatial velocities are not the
///     Plücker vectors defined in [Featherstone 2008, Ch. 2].
///     Note: `H_FM` is only a function of the `nq` generalized positions `q`.
/// - H_FMᵀ(q):
///     H_FMᵀ is the `nv x 6` matrix transpose of `H_FM`.  It relates the `nv`
///     generalized forces `tau` to `F_Mo_F` (the spatial force on frame M at
///     point Mo, expressed in F) as `tau = H_FMᵀ ⋅ F_Mo_F`
///     The %Mobilizer method ProjectSpatialForce() calculates `tau`.
///     Be aware that Drake's spatial forces are not the Plücker vectors defined
///     in [Featherstone 2008, Ch. 2].
/// - Hdot_FM(q, v):
///     The time derivative of the mobilizer hinge matrix `H_FM` is used in the
///     calculation of `A_FM(q, v, v̇)` (outboard frame M's spatial acceleration
///     in its inboard frame F, expressed in F) as
///     `A_FM(q, v, v̇) = H_FM(q) * v̇ + Ḣ_FM(q, v) * v`.  The %Mobilizer method
///     CalcAcrossMobilizerSpatialAcceleration() calculates `A_FM`.
/// - N(q):
///     This `nq x nv` kinematic coupling matrix relates q̇ (the time-derivative
///     of the nq mobilizer's generalized positions) to `v` (the mobilizer's
///     generalized velocities) as `q̇ = N(q) * v`, [Seth 2010].
///     The %Mobilizer method MapVelocityToQDot() calculates `N(q)`.
/// - N⁺(q):
///     The left pseudo-inverse of `N(q)`. `N⁺(q)` can be used to invert the
///     relationship `q̇ = N(q) * v` without residual error, provided that `q̇` is
///     in the range space of `N(q)` (that is, if it *could* have been produced
///     as `q̇ = N(q) * v` for some `v`). The application `v = N⁺(q) * q̇` is
///     implemented in MapQDotToVelocity().
///
/// In general, `nv != nq`. As an example, consider a quaternion mobilizer that
/// would allow frame M to move freely with respect to frame F. For such a
/// mobilizer the generalized positions vector might contain a quaternion to
/// describe rotations plus a position vector to describe translations. However,
/// we might choose the angular velocity `w_FM` and the linear velocity `v_FM`
/// as the generalized velocities (or more generally, the spatial velocity
/// `V_FM`.) In such a case `nq = 7` (4 dofs for a quaternion plus 3 dofs for a
/// position vector) and `nv = 6` (3 dofs for an angular velocity and 3 dofs for
/// a linear velocity).
///
/// For a detailed discussion on the concept of a mobilizer please refer to
/// [Seth 2010]. The mobilizer "hinge" matrix `H_FM(q)` is introduced in
/// [Jain 2010], though be aware that what [Jain 2010] calls the hinge matrix is
/// the transpose of the mobilizer hinge matrix H_FM matrix here in Drake.
/// For details in the monogram notation used above please refer to
/// @ref multibody_spatial_algebra.
///
/// %Mobilizer is an abstract base class defining the minimum functionality that
/// derived %Mobilizer objects must implement in order to fully define the
/// kinematic relationship between the two frames they connect.
///
/// <h4>Relation between hinge matrix and Jacobians</h4>
///
/// The relationship between the across-mobilizer spatial velocity `V_FM` and
/// the time derivative of the across-mobilizer transform `X_FM` is similar to
/// the relationship between the rigid transform Jacobian Jq_X_VM (partial
/// derivatives of rigid transform X_FM with respect to generalized positions q)
/// and the Drake mobilizer hinge matrix `H_FM` (partial derivatives of
/// across-mobilizer q̇ with respect to generalized velocities v).
///
/// The translational velocity v_FM component of the spatial velocity `V_FM` is
/// defined as the time derivative of the position vector p_FM in `X_FM`. <pre>
///   v_FM = dp_FM/dt = ∂p_FM/∂q * q̇ = ∂p_FM/∂q * N(q) * v = Hv_FM * v
/// </pre>
/// where `Hv_FM = ∂p_FM/∂q * N(q)` is the last three rows in `H_FM`.
///
/// The angular velocity w_FM component of the spatial velocity `V_FM` can be
/// related to the time derivative of the rotation matrix R_FM in `X_FM`. This
/// complicated relationship can be written in terms of the skew symmetric
/// angular velocity matrix [w_FM] as <pre>
///  [w_FM] = d(R_FM)/dt * (R_FM)ᵀ
/// </pre>
/// The ordinary time-derivative of the rotation matrix R_FM is <pre>
///   d(R_FM)/dt = ∂R/∂q * q̇ = ∂R/∂q * N(q) * v
/// </pre>
/// Combining the previous two equations leads to <pre>
///  [w_FM] = ∂R/∂q * N(q) * v * (R_FM)ᵀ
/// </pre>
/// Post-multiplying both sides of the previous equation by R_FM gives <pre>
///  [w_FM] * R_FM = ∂R/∂q * N(q) * v
/// </pre>
/// `Hw_FM` is the first three rows in `H_FM`, defined by context as <pre>
///  Hw_FM * R_FM = ∂R/∂q * N(q)
/// </pre>
///
/// <h4>Active forces and power</h4>
///
/// The power generated by a mobilizer can be computed in two equivalent ways.
/// That is, the power can be computed in terms of the spatial force `F_Mo` and
/// the spatial velocity `V_FM` as: <pre>
///   P = F_Moᵀ * V_FM
/// </pre>
/// or in terms of the generalized forces `tau = H_FMᵀ(q) ⋅ F_Mo` and the
/// generalized velocities v as: <pre>
///   P = tauᵀ * v
/// </pre>
/// Notice that spatial forces in the null space of `H_FM(q)` do not perform any
/// work.  Since the result from the previous two expressions must be equal, the
/// mobilizer hinge matrix `H_FM(q)` and its transpose `H_FMᵀ(q)` are
/// constrained by: <pre>
///   (H_FMᵀ(q) * F) * v = Fᵀ * (H_FM(q) * v), ∀ v ∈ ℝⁿᵛ ∧ `F ∈ F⁶`
/// </pre>
/// Therefore, this enforces a relationship to the operations implemented by
/// CalcAcrossMobilizerSpatialVelocity() and ProjectSpatialForce() for any
/// %Mobilizer object.
