/// This %ForceElement models a revolute DoorHinge joint that could exhibit
/// different force/torque characteristics at different states due to the
/// existence of different type of torques on the joint. This class implements
/// a "christmas tree" accumulation of these different torques in an empirical
/// and unprincipled way. Specifically, different curves are assigned to
/// different torques to mimic their evolution based on the joint state and
/// some prespecified parameters.
///
/// Torques considered in this implementation include:
///   * torsional spring torque (τ_ts) -- position dependent
///   * catch torque            (τ_c)  -- position dependent
///   * dynamic friction torque (τ_df) -- velocity dependent
///   * static friction torque  (τ_sf) -- velocity dependent
///   * viscous friction torque (τ_vf) -- velocity dependent
///
/// We then implement two curves to approximate the progression of different
/// torques. A curve `s(t, x) = tanh(x/t)` uses the `tanh` function to
/// approximate a step curve ({`x<0`: -1 ; `x>0`: 1}) outside of `-t < x < t`.
/// The curve `doublet(t, x) = 2 * s * (1 − s²)` is the second derivative of `s`
/// scaled by `-t²`, which yields a lump at negative `x` that integrates to -1
/// and a lump at positive `x` that integrates to 1. Finally, the total
/// external torque on the hinge joint would be:
///
///  `τ = τ_ts + τ_c + τ_df + τ_sf + τ_vf`.
///
/// where `τ_ts = -k_ts * (q − qs₀)`, `τ_c = k_c * doublet(qc₀/2, q − qc₀/2)`,
///  `τ_df = -k_df * s(k_q̇₀, q̇)`, `τ_sf = -k_sf * doublet(k_q̇₀, q̇)` and
/// `τ_vf = -k_vf * q̇`. The door is assumed to be closed at `q=0`, opening
/// in the positive-q direction. Note that, the sign of the torques depends on
/// two elements: one is the sign of the torque related constants and another
/// one is the sign of the assigned curves. For example, as defined above, the
/// static friction torque `τ_sf` should be opposite to the direction of the
/// velocity q̇. The catch torque `τ_c` should be negative when `q < qc₀/2` and
/// positive otherwise. This class applies all hinge-originating forces, so it
/// can be used instead of the SDF viscous damping. The users could change the
/// values of these different elements to obtain different characteristics for
/// the DoorHinge joint that the users want to model. A jupyter notebook tool
/// is also provided to help the users visualize the curves and design
/// parameters.  Run
/// `bazel run //bindings/pydrake/multibody:examples/door_hinge_inspector`
/// to bring up the notebook.
///
/// **To give an example**, a common dishwasher door has a frictional torque
/// sufficient for it to rest motionless at any angle, a catch at the top to
/// hold it in place, a dashpot (viscous friction source) to prevent it from
/// swinging too fast, and a spring to counteract some of its mass. Two
/// figures are provided to illustrate the dishwasher DoorHinge torque with the
/// given default parameters. Figure 1 shows the static characteristic of the
/// dishwasher door. At q = 0, there exists a negative catch torque to prevent
/// the door from moving. After that, the torsional spring torque will dominate
/// to compensate part of the door gravity. Figure 2 shows the dynamic feature
/// of the dishwasher door at q = 30 deg. It shows the door can be closed easily
/// since the torque is small when the velocity is negative. However, whenever
/// the door intends to open further, there will be a counter torque to prevent
/// that movement, which therefore keeps the door at rest. Note that, due to
/// the gravity, the dishwasher door will be fully open eventually. This
/// process can be really slow because of the default `motion_threshold` is
/// set to be very small. You can change the `motion_threshold` parameter to
/// adjust the time.
