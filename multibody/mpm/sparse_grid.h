/* SparseGrid is a 3D grid that is sparsely populated with GridData (see
 multibody::mpm::internal::GridData) implemented with a Sparse Paged Grid
 (SpGrid) data structure (see multibody::mpm::internal::SpGrid). The SparseGrid
 class is used to allocate, set, and access grid data in an MPM simulation.
 Usually, there is only one SparseGrid in an entire MPM simulation, and all
 particles interact with this grid. The MPM algorithm should use this class to
 perform operations like particle-to-grid (P2G) and grid-to-particle (G2P)
 transfers, instead of directly accessing underlying SpGrid.

 Here we recall a few terminologies (defined elsewhere) and define a few new
 ones that are used in the documentation below.

 Recall that a grid node is the "base node" of a particle if it's the closest
 grid node to the particle. Also recall that a "pad" in a grid is a 3x3x3
 subgrid. We define that a grid node is "in the support" of a particle if it
 belongs to a pad whose center node is the base node of the particle. A grid
 node is said to be "supported" if it is in the support of at least one
 particle.

 Recall that a "block" in an SpGrid is a rectangular subgrid that occupies a
 continuous chunk of memory of size 4kB (a "page"). The SparseGrid class
 allocates memory in units of these blocks; it allocates for a block if it might
 contain a supported grid node. See `Allocate` for more details.

       - A const reference to the positions of the pad of grid nodes supported
         by the particle.
       - A const reference to the pad of grid data.
