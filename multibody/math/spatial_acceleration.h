/// This class represents a _spatial acceleration_ class and has 6 elements with

/// elements (namely Œ± and ùêö) and does not store the underlying frames B, M, E.
/// The user is responsible for explicitly tracking the underlying frames with
/// @ref multibody_quantities "monogram notation". For example, A_MB_E denotes

/// and a_MBo_E (Bo's translational acceleration measured in M, expressed in E),
/// where Bo is frame B's origin point.
/// For an @ref multibody_frames_and_bodies "offset frame" Bp, the monogram

  /// This operation can be performed with the method

  ///
  /// @note Alternatively, we can write an efficient version of the
