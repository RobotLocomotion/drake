/// </pre>
/// where `mᵢ` and `v_NQi` are the mass and linear velocity (in frame N) of the
/// i-th particle in the system, respectively. Their product `l_NQi = mᵢv_NQi`
/// is the linear momentum of the i-th particle in the N reference frame.
/// The angular momentum `h_NSp` of a system of particles S in a reference frame
/// N about an arbitrary point P is defined by: <pre>
///   h_NSp = ∑ p_PQi x l_NQi
/// </pre>
/// where `p_PQi` is the position vector from point P to the i-th particle
/// position `Qi`.
/// The definitions above extend to a continuum of particles as: <pre>
///   h_NSp = ∫p_PQ(r) x v_NQ(r) ρ(r)d³r
///   l_NS = ∫v_NQ(r) ρ(r)d³r
/// </pre>
/// where `ρ(r)` is the density of the body at each material location `r`.
/// In particular, the continuum version above also applies to rigid bodies.
///
/// Spatial momenta are elements of F⁶ (see [Featherstone 2008]) that combine
/// both rotational (angular momentum) and translational (linear momentum)
/// components. Spatial momenta are 6-element quantities that are pairs of
/// ordinary 3-vectors. Elements 0-2 are the angular momentum component while
/// elements 3-5 are the linear momentum component. As with any other spatial
/// vector, both vector components must be expressed in the same frame.
///
/// Neither the expressed-in frame nor the about-point are stored with a
/// %SpatialMomentum object; they must be understood from context. It is the
/// responsibility of the user to keep track of the about-point and the
/// expressed-in frame. That is best accomplished through disciplined notation.
/// In source code we use monogram notation where L designates a spatial
/// momentum quantity. The spatial momentum of a system S in a frame N about an
/// arbitrary point P, expressed in a frame E is typeset as @f$[^NL^{S/P}]_E@f$,
/// which appears in code as `L_NSP_E`. The spatial momentum of a body B in a
/// frame N about the body origin Bo is explicitly typeset as L_NBBo_E, but we
/// abbreviate it as L_NBo_E.  Similarly, the spatial momentum of a system S in
/// a frame N about Scm (the system center of mass), expressed in a frame E is
/// explicitly typeset as L_NSScm_E, but we abbreviate it as L_NScm_E.
/// For a more detailed introduction on spatial vectors and the monogram
/// notation please refer to section @ref multibody_spatial_vectors.
