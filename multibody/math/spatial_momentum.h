/// This class represents a _spatial momentum_ L and has 6 elements with an
/// angular (rotational) momentum ùê° (3-element vector) on top of a translational
/// (linear) momentum ùê• (3-element vector). A spatial momentum L stores the
/// angular momentum ùê° and translational momentum ùê• of a system S about a point
/// P, measured in a frame M, and expressed in a frame E. The system S may be a
/// particle, a rigid or deformable body, or a set of particles and/or bodies.
/// This class assumes that both the angular momentum ùê° and translational
/// momentum ùê• are expressed in the same _expressed-in_ frame E. This class only
/// stores 6 elements (namely ùê° and ùê•) and does not store the underlying
/// system S, about-point P, measured-in frame M, or expressed-in frame E.
/// The user is responsible for explicitly tracking the underlying system,
/// about-point, and frames with @ref multibody_quantities "monogram notation".
/// For example, L_MSP_E denotes a system S's spatial momentum about point P,
/// measured in frame M, and expressed in frame E. L_MSP_E contains h_MSP_E
/// (S's angular momentum about point P, measured in M, expressed in E) and
/// l_MS_E (S's translational momentum measured in M, expressed in E). A body
/// B's spatial momentum about point Bo (B's origin), measured in frame M,
/// expressed in frame E has explicit monogram notation L_MBBo_E which can be
/// abbreviated L_MBo_E. Similarly L_MSScm_E is abbreviated L_MScm_E (Scm is
/// S's center of mass). Details on spatial vectors and monogram notation are in
/// sections @ref multibody_spatial_vectors and @ref multibody_quantities.
///
/// The typeset for L_MSP_E is @f$[^ML^{S/P}]_E@f$. For a set S of particles Q·µ¢,
/// L_MSP contains S's angular momentum ùê° about-point P, measured in frame M
/// and S's translational momentum ùê• measured in frame M, defined as <pre>
///   h_MSP = ‚àë h_MQ·µ¢P = ‚àë p_PQ·µ¢ x l_MQ·µ¢  where l_MQ·µ¢ = m·µ¢ v_MQ·µ¢.
///   l_MS  = ‚àë l_MQ·µ¢  = ‚àë m·µ¢ v_MQ·µ¢

/// measured in frame M, h_MQ·µ¢P is Q·µ¢'s angular momentum about point P
