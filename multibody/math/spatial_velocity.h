/// of a translational (linear) velocity v (3-element vector). Spatial velocity
/// represents the rotational and translational motion of a frame B with respect
/// to a _measured-in_ frame M. This class assumes that both the angular
/// velocity œâ and translational velocity v are expressed in the same
/// _expressed-in_ frame E. This class only stores 6 elements (namely œâ and v)
/// and does not store the underlying frames B, M, E. The user is responsible
/// for explicitly tracking the underlying frames with @ref multibody_quantities
/// "monogram notation". For example, V_MB_E denotes frame B's spatial velocity
/// measured in frame M, expressed in frame E and contains œâ_MB_E (B's angular
/// velocity measured in M, expressed in E) and v_MBo_E (Bo's translational
/// velocity measured in M, expressed in E), where Bo is frame B's origin point.
/// For an @ref multibody_frames_and_bodies "offset frame" Bp, the monogram
