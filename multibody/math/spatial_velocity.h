/// This class represents a _spatial velocity_ (also called a _twist_) and has
/// 6 elements with a rotational (angular) velocity w (ordinary 3-vector) on top
/// of a translational (linear) velocity v (ordinary 3-vector).
/// A spatial velocity represents the rotational and translational motion of a
/// frame B with respect to a "measured-in" frame A. This class assumes that
/// both the rotational velocity w and translational velocity v are expressed
/// in the same "expressed-in" frame E.
/// This class only stores 6 elements (namely w and v) and does not store the
/// underlying frames B, A, E or the point of B associated with v.  The user is
/// responsible for keeping track of the underlying frames B, A, E, etc., which
/// is best done through monogram notation.  For a point Bp that is fixed to a
/// frame (or body) B, the spatial velocity of point Bp of frame B measured in
/// frame A, expressed in frame E is denoted `V_ABp_E`. `V_ABp_E` contains
/// w_AB_E (B's rotational velocity w measured in A, expressed in E) and
/// v_ABp_E (point Bp's translational velocity v measured in A, expressed in E).
/// The abbreviated monogram notation V_AB_E denotes the spatial velocity of
/// frame B's origin (Bo) measured in A, expressed in E.  Details on spatial
/// vectors and monogram notation are in section @ref multibody_spatial_vectors.
