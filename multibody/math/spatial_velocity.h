/// This class represents a _spatial velocity_ (also called a _twist_) and has

/// of a translational (linear) velocity v (3-element vector).
/// A spatial velocity represents the rotational and translational motion of a
/// frame B with respect to a "measured-in" frame A. This class assumes that
/// both the rotational velocity w and translational velocity v are expressed
/// in the same "expressed-in" frame E.  This class only stores 6 elements
/// (namely w and v) and does not store the underlying frames B, A, E.  The user
/// is responsible for keeping track of these underlying frames which is best
/// done through monogram notation. The spatial velocity of a frame B measured
/// in a frame A, expressed in frame E is denoted `V_AB_E`. `V_AB_E` contains
/// w_AB_E (B's rotational velocity w measured in A, expressed in E) and
/// v_ABo_E (Bo's translational velocity measured in A, expressed in E), where
/// Bo is the frame B's origin point.  For an @ref multibody_frames_and_bodies
/// "offset frame" Bp, the monogram notation V_ABp_E denotes the spatial
/// velocity of frame Bp measured in A, expressed in E.  Details on spatial
/// vectors and monogram notation are in section @ref multibody_spatial_vectors.
