/// which is best done through @ref multibody_quantities "monogram notation".
/// The spatial velocity of a frame B measured in a frame A, expressed in a
/// frame E is denoted `V_AB_E`. `V_AB_E` contains œâ_AB_E (B's rotational
/// velocity œâ measured in A, expressed in E) and v_ABo_E (Bo's translational
/// velocity measured in A, expressed in E), where Bo is the frame B's origin
/// point.  For an @ref multibody_frames_and_bodies "offset frame" Bp, the
