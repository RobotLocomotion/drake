/// This class represents a _spatial force_ (also called a _wrench_) and has 6
/// elements with a torque ùõï (3-element vector) on top of a force ùêü (3-element
/// vector). Frequently, a spatial force represents the replacement of a set S
/// of forces on a frame B with an equivalent set consisting of a torque ùõï
/// applied to frame B which is equal to the moment of the set S about a point
/// Bp of B together with a force ùêü applied to Bp, where ùêü is equal to set S's
/// resultant force.  This class assumes that both the torque ùõï and force ùêü have
/// the same _expressed-in_ frame E. This class only stores 6 elements (namely
/// ùõï and ùêü) and does not store the underlying frame B, expressed-in frame E, or
/// application point Bp. The user is responsible for explicitly tracking these
/// underlying quantities with @ref multibody_quantities "monogram notation".
/// For example, F_B_E denotes a spatial force on frame B, expressed in frame E
/// and contains tau_B_E (torque applied to frame B, expressed in frame E) and
/// f_Bo_E (force applied frame B's origin point Bo, expressed in E).
///
/// The monogram notation F_Bp has a typeset equivalent @f${F^{Bp}}@f$ which
/// denotes the spatial force applied to point Bp of frame B.  F_Bp contains a
/// torque tau_B (@f${\tau^B}@f$) applied to frame B and a force f_Bp
/// (@f${f^{Bp}}@f$) applied to point Bp of frame B.
/// Details on spatial vectors and monogram notation are in sections
/// @ref multibody_spatial_vectors and @ref multibody_quantities.
