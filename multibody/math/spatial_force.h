/// This class is used to represent a _spatial force_ (also called a _wrench_)
/// that combines both rotational (torque) and translational force components.
/// Spatial forces are 6-element quantities that are pairs of ordinary
/// 3-vectors. Elements 0-2 are the torque component while elements 3-5 are the
/// force component.
/// Both vectors must be expressed in the same frame, and the translational
/// force is applied to a particular point of a body, but neither the frame nor
/// the point are stored with a %SpatialForce object; they must be understood
/// from context. It is the responsibility of the user to keep track of the
/// application point and the expressed-in frame. That is best accomplished
/// through disciplined notation. In source code we use monogram notation
/// where capital F is used to designate a spatial force quantity. We write
/// a point P fixed to body (or frame) B as @f$B_P@f$ which appears in
/// code and comments as `Bp`. Then we write a particular spatial force as
/// `F_Bp_E` where the `_E` suffix indicates that the expressed-in frame
/// is E. This symbol represents a torque applied to body B, and a force
/// applied to point P on B, with both vectors expressed in E. Very often
/// the application point will be the body origin `Bo`; if no point is
/// shown the origin is understood, so `F_B_E` means `F_Bo_E`.
/// For a more detailed introduction on spatial vectors and the monogram
/// notation please refer to section @ref multibody_spatial_vectors.
