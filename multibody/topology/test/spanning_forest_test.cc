/* Creates a straightforward graph of two trees each with multiple branches,
plus a lone unattached free link. There are no welds or reverse joints or loops.
We intentionally jumble the link numbering to make sure we don't get the right
forest numbering by luck. We'll use this to test that basic numbering and
reporting works. We'll reuse this in several tests with different options.

Here is the original graph and its expected forest model:

              Links                                Mobods

                             15                               13
                       13  14                           11  12
           9  10         11                     5  6      10
       5    6            8   7     -->      3    4        9   14
          4                3                   2            8
          1       2       12                   1            7      15

          ..........0..........                ...........0..........

Note the depth-first ordering in the Forest. We won't provide joints to World
but the modeler's base body policy should choose Links 1, 2, and 12 and add
appropriate joints. Also note our policy of moving all singleton free
links to the highest-numbered mobods.

Note also that the left link tree maps to forest tree0, the right link tree
maps to forest tree1, and the free link is forest tree2. */

/* Verify that we can build a good forest for a serial chain, some static and

Links can become static either by being members of a static model instance,
or by having been specified with the kStatic link flag; we test both of those
here. Forest building should add a weld joint to World for every static link
unless there is already an explicit weld; we'll check that.

LinkComposites are always computed and consist of subgraphs of links that are
mutually welded together (directly or indirectly). Depending on forest building
options, we may use a single Mobod for a LinkComposite, or we may use a Mobod
for each of those welded-together links. In the latter case we also compute
"welded Mobod" groups consisting of Mobods that are mutually interconnected by
weld mobilizers (directly or indirectly). When we're modeling each
LinkComposite with just one Mobod, there won't be any welded-together Mobods.
By convention, there will still be one welded Mobod group, consisting just
of the World Mobod.

We'll also check that coordinates are assigned properly and that pre-calculated
forest counts are correct.

The LinkJointGraph

      free9           (no joint)
      link10=>base11* (free floating but welded together)

    * link10 would be the preferred base link but link 11 "base11" is marked
      "must be base link" so we have to use a reversed mobilizer there

SpanningForest 1 (don't combine LinkComposites)
-----------------------------------------------
  ≡> added weld joint       [mobods]
  6> added floating joint   {links}

  When building the forest in the mode where every Link gets its own Mobod
  (even if Links are welded together) the SpanningForest should have 6 trees of
  Mobods (World is not in a tree):

  tree      world [0]
     0 [1-5]  ->link1->link2->link3->link4->link5
     1 [6]    =>static7
     2 [7]    ≡>static6        (added weld)
     3 [8]    ≡>static8        (added weld)
     4 [9-10] 6>base11=>link10 (added 6dof, reversed the user's weld)
     5 [11]   6>free9          (added 6dof, free bodies are always last)

  LinkComposites:  {0 7 6 8} {11 10}
  Welded Mobods groups: [0 6 7 8] [9 10]

  The particular ordering results from (a) user-supplied Joints get processed
  before added ones, and (b) static model instance Links get welded prior
  to individually-specified static Links in non-static model instances.
  However, note that we do not promise any particular ordering other than
  (1) World is always present and is first, and (2) the active link comes first
  in any LinkComposite.

 yet combined. More cases will follow.

    {9}

When we build the forest, we have to provide every link with a path to World.
We'll first process the upper graph which already starts at World. Then we
have to pick a base body for the next graph. Link {3} should be chosen since
it appears only as a parent; it gets floating joint 14. Link {9} will also be
a base body; it gets floating joint 15.

There are three loops in this graph: {7-2-11}, {13-1-4}, and {10-6-8}. The
forest-building algorithm will encounter them in that order. The last two loops
are formed entirely of welds. When modeling in the mode where every Joint gets a
Mobod all of these must be broken by adding shadow links. In each case the loop
joint will be between two bodies at the same level in their tree, so the choice
of which one to split should be made so that the parent->child orientation in
the graph is preserved in the inboard->outboard order of the tree, requiring
that the child Link is the one split. (It is easier to see the levels in the
forest diagram below.) As a result, Link {11} will be split with shadow link
{14*} on Joint 8, Link {1} gets shadow {15*} on weld Joint 1, and Link {8} gets
shadow {16*} on weld Joint 6.

Therefore we expect the following Composites, with the "World" Composite first:
  {0, 5, 7, 12}, {13, 1, 4, 15*}, {10, 6, 8, 16*}
Note that the _active_ Link (the one on a moving joint) is always listed first
in a LinkComposite (World comes first in the World composite). The remaining
non-composite links are {3}, {9}, {2}, {11}, and {14*}.

Forest building should start with Link {5} since that is the only direct
connection to World in the input ({3} and {9} get connected later). If we're
giving every Link its own mobilizer (rather than making composites from
welded-together ones) we expect this forest of 3 trees and 17 Mobods:

      level 6                 12{16*} ....              ... loop constraint
                                         .              {1} link # in braces
      level 5                  11{6}  13{8}             10  mobod # plain

      level 4  4{14*} ...        10{10}    . 15{15*}
                        .                ..
      level 3   3{2} 5{11}         9{1}..   14{4}

      level 2      2{7}   6{12}        8{13}

  base mobods          1{5}            7{3}            16{9}

        World              ............0{0}.............

Note that the Mobod numbers shown here (and in all the tests) are _after_
renumbering into depth first order, not the order in which the Mobods were
assigned.

Some of the Links are welded together. We call those LinkComposites even
though each Link has its own Mobod. Those are:
{0 5 7 12} {13 1 4 15} {10 6 8 16}
The corresponding Mobods are in WeldedMobod groups:
[0 1 2 6] [8 9 14 15] [10 11 13 12]

contain links {1} and {3} before we discover the loop trying to extend Tree 1
from link {2} via joint 3. In that case link {3} is at level 2 in the forest
while link {2} is at level 1 so we must split {3} to get the two trees to be
the same height. Link {3} is split so there is a shadow 3s, which has

Notes:
  - Joint numbering determines branch ordering in the tree so the
    middle branch gets modeled last.
  - Model Joint 8 is the added floating joint to World.
  - Link {8} is {6s} (shadow 1 of Link {6}); {9} is {6ss} (shadow 2).
  - Loop constraints (shown as . .) are always ordered so that the constraint's
    "parent" is the primary link and "child" is the shadow link. Thus the order
    here should be 6->8 and 6->9.
  - Mobilized bodies (Mobods) are numbered depth-first.

/* We always preserve the user's parent->child order for a joint, even if we
have to use a reversed mobilizer to do so. This requires some special handling
when we introduce a shadow body -- the shadow _mobod_ is always outboard (in
fact, terminal), but it might be the shadow of a _link_ that was the parent for
the joint being modeled. This test verifies that all the relevant bookkeeping is
done properly, both for the shadow body and the ephemeral Link we create for it
in the LinkJointGraph.

While we're here we'll verify that the shadow link naming policy works
properly when some crazy user has named their links to look like shadows.

After we verify the above, we'll change {3} to massless which will force
us to split link {2} instead. In that case we won't need a reverse mobilizer:
