/* This is the algorithm that takes an arbitrary link-joint graph and models
it as a spanning forest of mobilized bodies plus loop-closing constraints.

@note An assumption that affects some implementation choices: in a large system,
most links will be either (1) welded to World or to each other to create complex
objects, or (2) free bodies representing manipulands. The number of articulated
links representing a robot or robots will be modest in comparison. Hence we
want to handle welded and free links efficiently.

The algorithm has three phases:
  1 Produce the best tree structures we can in one pass. For example, when
    breaking loops we want to minimize the maximum branch length for better
    numerics, but we can't allow massless terminal bodies unless they are welded
    to a massful body. Welded-together Links form a LinkComposite which can
    (optionally) be modeled using a single mobilized body.
  2 Reorder the forest nodes (mobilized bodies) depth first for optimal
    computation. Each tree will consist only of consecutively-numbered nodes.
  3 Assign joint coordinates q and velocities v sequentially according
    to the depth-first ordering.

  During execution of this algorithm, we opportunistically collect information
  that can be used for fast queries at run time, both for the graph and the
  forest. For example: Which Links are welded together (LinkComposites)?
  Which Mobods are welded together (WeldedMobod groups)? Which of
  those are anchored to World? Which Tree does a given Mobod belong to? How
  many coordinates are inboard or outboard of a Mobod?

ForestBuildingOptions (global or per-model instance) determine
  - whether we produce a mobilized body for _each_ Link or just for each
    _assembly_ of welded-together Links (a LinkComposite), and
  - what kind of Joint we use to mobilize unconnected root Links: 0 dof fixed,
    6 dof roll-pitch-yaw floating, or 6 dof quaternion floating.

Here is an expansion of the above three phases. The code refers back to the
numbering here for clarification.

1. Construct a forest with good topology
   1.1 Add the World mobilized body to the forest at level 0.
   1.2 Add missing Joints to World if needed for
     a) Links in a Static ModelInstance,
     b) Links explicitly flagged "Static", and
     c) Links marked "MustBeBaseBody".
     (Links can be static due to individual LinkFlags or membership in a static
     model instance.)
   1.3 ExtendTrees(all existing base bodies)   (see algorithm E below)
   1.4 While there are unprocessed _jointed_ (articulated) Links
     a) Choose an unprocessed Link L and model it with a new Mobod B that is
        to be the root node (base body) of a new tree. L is chosen by picking
        the "best" base Link according to some policy.
        (Heuristic: pick one that never appears as a child of a Joint.)
     b) ExtendTrees(B)  (just this one tree; see algorithm E below)
   1.5 While there are unprocessed _unjointed_ Links (single bodies)
     a) Each of these can be the base body of a new one-Mobod tree
     b) If a Link is in a "use fixed base" model instance, weld it to World.
        If we're combining welded links it just joins the World LinkComposite
        and does not form a new Tree.
     c) Otherwise add a floating Joint to World (rpy or quaternion depending
        on options) and start a new Tree.
     d) Note that any unjointed _static_ Link, or a Link in a static model
        instance, had a weld joint added in step 1.2 above so was processed in
        the first call to ExtendTrees().

   E. Algorithm ExtendTrees(tree_base_bodies):
      E.1 Extend each tree one level at a time.
      E.2 Process all level 1 (base) Links directly jointed to World.
      E.3 Then process all level 2 Links jointed to level 1 Links, etc.
      E.4 Composites are (optionally) modeled with a single Mobod (one level).
      E.5 If we encounter a Link that has already been processed there is a
          loop. Split the Link into primary and shadow Links, and allocate
          two Mobods, one for each of those to follow. Add a loop constraint to
          weld them back together.
      E.6 Don't end a level with a massless Link; if we encounter one
          keep going until we can end on a massful Link.

2. Reorder depth first
   2.1 Determine the depth first re-ordering of the mobilized bodies.
   2.2 Use that reordering to update the SpanningForest in place.

3. Assign coordinates q and velocities v
   3.1 Each tree gets a consecutive set of q's and a consecutive set of v's,
       doled out following the depth-first ordering of the trees.
   3.2 Build maps from q and v to corresponding Mobod (includes fast q,v->Tree
       also).
   3.3 Precalculate for each Mobod the number of coordinates along its inboard
       path to World and in the outboard subtree for which it is the root.

     keep growing that branch until we can end with something massful. If we

     matrix will be singular.

Exception 1 preserves the goal of minimizing maximum branch length since we
still only advance by one Mobod, regardless of how many merged Links that
entails.

Exception 2 sacrifices the even growth of branches in order to achieve the more
critical goal of ending every branch with a massful body to avoid making the
system mass matrix singular.

Definitions used below
----------------------
- Given a link L, we denote the _merged_ LinkComposite it belongs to as L+.
    If we're not merging (optimizing) LinkComposites, then L+ == L.
- A joint connects two links, parent and child. Every joint of interest here
    has at least one of its links already in the forest; that is its "inboard"
    link I. The other link is the "outboard" link O and is usually not yet in
    the forest.
- A "merged joint" is a weld joint that connects two links that should be part
    of the same merged LinkComposite. Merged joints do not have a corresponding
    mobilizer in the forest; they are unmodeled.
- Define Jₒₚₑₙ(L+) as the set of all not-yet-processed joints connected to any
    link in L+. These are "open" in the sense that only inboard link I of the
    joint is in L+; the other link O still needs to be dealt with. Open joints
    define the next level to be added to the forest outboard of L+.


Algorithm A(Jᵢₙ, &Jₒᵤₜ)
-----------------------
Inputs:  graph, partially built forest F, a set Jᵢₙ of unmodeled joints that
         will extend F by one level (i.e. one joint per branch).
Outputs: updated forest F, the set Jₒᵤₜ of as-yet-unmodeled joints to add at
         the next level.

Note: Every j ∈ Jᵢₙ has at least one of its two links (parent and child) already
  modeled in the current forest F. On return, every j ∈ Jₒᵤₜ has at least one of
  its links already modeled in the updated forest. In either case, if both
  links are already in the forest then j is a loop joint.

Jₒᵤₜ = {}
For each jᵢₙ ∈ Jᵢₙ:
  A.1 If jᵢₙ should be a merged joint (see above), then merge O+ with the
      LinkComposite I+. Mark weld joint jᵢₙ as "unmodeled". We haven't yet
      extended this branch by a level though, so we need to keep going.
      Set Jₗₑᵥₑₗ = Jₒₚₑₙ(O+). Otherwise (jᵢₙ not a merged joint), set
      Jₗₑᵥₑₗ = {jᵢₙ}.

  For each jₗₑᵥₑₗ ∈ Jₗₑᵥₑₗ:
    A.2 If both parent and child links of jₗₑᵥₑₗ are already in the forest,
        jₗₑᵥₑₗ is a loop closing joint. Handle the loop. -> NEXT jₗₑᵥₑₗ
    A.3 Otherwise, add a new Mobod M to the forest whose body models link O and
        whose mobilizer models joint jₗₑᵥₑₗ.
    A.4 Determine O+ (O or its composite) and make all links in O+ follow M.
    A.5 If M is massful, set Jₒᵤₜ += Jₒₚₑₙ(O+). -> NEXT jₗₑᵥₑₗ
    A.6 (M is massless) Examine the joints in Jₒₚₑₙ(O+). If there aren't any
        open joints then we have to terminate this branch with a massless body
        and note that the forest can't be used for dynamics. Make a note and a
