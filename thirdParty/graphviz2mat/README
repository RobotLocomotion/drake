MATLAB <-> GraphViz   by Dr. Leon Peshkin: pesha @ ai.mit.edu | http://www.ai.mit.edu/~pesha 

this is a README file for `ad hoc' matlab package created to interaface 
AT&T GraphViz graph layout and MathWorks MATLAB user Interface powers.
Please make sure you have both Matlab and GraphViz properly installed on your system.
The package works on Unix and even on Windows. Use at your own risk. 

README          - this file
graph_to_dot.m  - Creates a GraphViz formated file from a graph given by an adjacency matrix.
dot_to_graph.m  - Extracts an adjacency matrix, node labels, and layout from a GraphViz file.
graph_draw.m    - Draws a graph in Matlab with a given layout
make_layout.m   - used to do a lame layout in case no layout is fed to graph_draw 
draw_dot.m      - a sample code illustrating use of package functions. 
                  draws a graph defined by adjacency matrix, by 
                    -first converting it to a GraphViz file (graph_to_dot)
                    -then calling NEATO of GraphViz to do a layout
                    -then importing layout file back into Matlab (dot_to_graph)
                    -finally calling graph_draw to display the layout
sample_click.m  - an auxiliary sample code which allows to right-mouse-click on the nodes of 
                  a graph to call a dummy function currently just printing that node's label
my_setdiff.m    - my version of setdiff() which works muchfaster 
                  
Disclaimers: This code resulted from developing, cleaning up and augmenting a few functions
which originally came with Kevin Murphy's  Bayesian Net Toolbox. Besides Kevin Murphy, several
other people get some credit:
