support is sufficient that a systems::Diagram with a
ContactResultsToLcmSystem can be scalar converted to
symbolic::Expression without error, but not necessarily evaluated.

**Constructing instances**

Generally, you shouldn't construct ContactResultsToLcmSystem instances
directly. We recommend using one of the overloaded
contact_result_vis_creation "ConnectContactResultsToDrakeVisualizer()"
functions to add contact visualization to your diagram.

**How contacts are described in visualization**

In the visualizer, each contact between two bodies is uniquely
characterized by two triples of names: (model instance name, body
name, geometry name). These triples help distinguish contacts which
might otherwise be ambiguous (e.g., contact with two bodies, both
called "box" but part of different model instances).

ContactResultsToLcmSystem gets the model instance and body names from
an instance of MultibodyPlant, but *geometry* names are not available
from the plant. By default, ContactResultsToLcmSystem will *generate*
a unique name based on a geometry's unique id (e.g., "Id(7)"). For
many applications (those cases where each body has only a single
collision geometry), this is perfectly acceptable. However, in cases
where a body has multiple collision geometries, those default names
may not be helpful when viewing the visualized results. Instead,
ContactResultsToLcmSystem can use the names associated with the id in
a geometry::SceneGraph instance. The only method for doing this is via
the contact_result_vis_creation
"ConnectContactResultsToDrakeVisualizer()" functions and requires the
diagram to be instantiated as double valued. If a diagram with a
different scalar type is required, it should subsequently be scalar
converted.

R"""(Parameters for Coulomb's Law of Friction, namely:

- Static friction coefficient, for a pair of surfaces at rest relative to
  each other.
- Dynamic (or kinematic) friction coefficient, for a pair of surfaces in
  relative motion.

These coefficients are an empirical property characterizing the
interaction by friction between a pair of contacting surfaces.
Friction coefficients depend upon the mechanical properties of the
surfaces' materials and on the roughness of the surfaces. They are
determined experimentally.

Even though the Coulomb's law coefficients of friction characterize a
pair of surfaces interacting by friction, we associate the abstract
**idea** of friction coefficients to a single surface by considering
the coefficients for contact between two identical surfaces. For this
case of two identical surfaces, the friction coefficients that
describe the surface pair are taken to equal those of one of the
identical surfaces. We extend this idea to the case of different
surfaces by defining a **combination law** that allow us to obtain the
Coulomb's law coefficients of friction characterizing the pair of
surfaces, given the individual friction coefficients of each surface.
We would like this **combination law** to satisfy:

- The friction coefficient of two identical surfaces is the friction
  coefficient of one of the surfaces.
- The combination law is commutative. That is, surface A combined with
  surface B gives the same results as surface B combined with surface A.
- For two surfaces M and N with very different friction coefficients, say
  ``μₘ ≪ μₙ``, the combined friction coefficient should be in the order of
  magnitude of the smallest friction coefficient (in the example μₘ). To
  understand this requirement, consider rubber (high friction coefficient)
  sliding on ice (low friction coefficient). We'd like the surface pair
  to be defined by a friction coefficient close to that of ice, since rubber
  will easily slide on ice.

These requirements are met by the following ad-hoc combination law:

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    μ = 2μₘμₙ/(μₘ + μₙ)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

See CalcContactFrictionFromSurfaceProperties(), which implements this
law. More complex combination laws could also be a function of other
parameters such as the mechanical properties of the interacting
surfaces or even their roughnesses. For instance, if the rubber
surface above has metal studs (somehow making the surface "rougher"),
it will definitely have a better grip on an ice surface. Therefore
this new variable should be taken into account in the combination law.
Notice that in this example, this new combination law model for tires,
will have a different set of requirements from the ones stated above.)""";

kTamsi, kSimilar and kLagged are all approximations to the same
contact model -- Compliant contact with regularized friction, refer to
mbp_contact_modeling "Contact Modeling" for further details. The key
difference however, is that the kSimilar and kLagged approximations
are convex and therefore our contact solver has both theoretical and
practical convergence guarantees --- the solver will always succeed.
Conversely, being non-convex, kTamsi can fail to find a solution.

kSap is also a convex model of compliant contact with regularized
friction. There are a couple of key differences however: - Dissipation
is modeled using a linear Kelvin–Voigt model, parameterized by a
relaxation time constant. See accessing_contact_properties "contact
parameters". - Unlike kTamsi, kSimilar and kLagged where
regularization of friction is parameterized by a stiction tolerance
(see set_stiction_tolerance()), SAP determines regularization
automatically solely based on numerics. Users have no control on the
amount of regularization.

How to choose an approximation

The Hunt & Crossley model is based on physics, it is continuous and
has been experimentally validated. Therefore it is the preferred model
to capture the physics of contact.

Being approximations, kSap and kSimilar introduce a spurious effect of
"gliding" in sliding contact, see [Castro et al., 2023]. This artifact
is 𝒪(δt) but can be significant at large time steps and/or large slip
velocities. kLagged does not suffer from this, but introduces a "weak"
coupling of friction that can introduce non-negligible effects in the
dynamics during impacts or strong transients.

Summarizing, kLagged is the preferred approximation when strong
transients are not expected or don't need to be accurately resolved.
If strong transients do need to be accurately resolved (unusual for
robotics applications), kSimilar is the preferred approximation.

Note: the SAP solver only fully supports scalar type ``double``. For
scalar type ``AutoDiffXd``, the SAP solver throws if any constraint
(including contact) is detected. As a consequence, one can only run
dynamic simulations without any constraints under the combination of
SAP and ``AutoDiffXd``. The SAP solver does not support symbolic
calculations.

**** Model Instances

A MultiBodyPlant may contain multiple model instances. Each model
instance corresponds to a set of bodies and their connections
(joints). Model instances provide methods to get or set the state of
the set of bodies (e.g., through GetPositionsAndVelocities() and
SetPositionsAndVelocities()), connecting controllers (through
get_state_output_port() and get_actuation_input_port()), and
organizing duplicate models (read through a parser). In fact, many
MultibodyPlant methods are overloaded to allow operating on the entire
plant or just the subset corresponding to the model instance; for
example, one GetPositions() method obtains the generalized positions
for the entire plant while another GetPositions() method obtains the
generalized positions for model instance.

Model instances are frequently defined through SDFormat files (using
the ``model`` tag) and are automatically created when SDFormat files
are parsed (by Parser). There are two special
multibody::ModelInstanceIndex values. The world body is always
multibody::ModelInstanceIndex 0. multibody::ModelInstanceIndex 1 is
reserved for all elements with no explicit model instance and is
generally only relevant for elements created programmatically (and
only when a model instance is not explicitly specified). Note that
Parser creates model instances (resulting in a
multibody::ModelInstanceIndex ≥ 2) as needed.

See num_model_instances(), num_positions(), num_velocities(),
num_actuated_dofs(), AddModelInstance() GetPositionsAndVelocities(),
GetPositions(), GetVelocities(), SetPositionsAndVelocities(),
SetPositions(), SetVelocities(), GetPositionsFromArray(),
GetVelocitiesFromArray(), SetPositionsInArray(),
SetVelocitiesInArray(), SetActuationInArray(),
HasModelInstanceNamed(), GetModelInstanceName(),
get_state_output_port(), get_actuation_input_port().

**** System dynamics

The state of a multibody system ``x = [q; v]`` is given by its
generalized positions vector q, of size ``nq`` (see num_positions()),
and by its generalized velocities vector v, of size ``nv`` (see
num_velocities()).

A MultibodyPlant can be constructed to be either continuous or
discrete. The choice is indicated by the time_step passed to the
constructor -- a non-zero time_step indicates a discrete plant, while
a zero time_step indicates continuous. A systems::Simulator
"Simulator" will step a discrete plant using the indicated time_step,
but will allow a numerical integrator to choose how to advance time
for a continuous MultibodyPlant.

We'll discuss continuous plant dynamics in this section. Discrete
dynamics is more complicated and gets its own section below.

As a Drake systems::System "System", MultibodyPlant implements the
governing equations for a multibody dynamical system in the form ``ẋ
= f(t, x, u)`` with t being time and u external inputs such as
actuation forces. The governing equations for the dynamics of a
multibody system modeled with MultibodyPlant are [Featherstone 2008,
Jain 2010]:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    q̇ = N(q)v
    (1)    M(q)v̇ + C(q, v)v = τ

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where ``M(q)`` is the mass matrix of the multibody system (including
rigid body mass properties and reflected_inertia "reflected
inertias"), ``C(q, v)v`` contains Coriolis, centripetal, and
gyroscopic terms and ``N(q)`` is the kinematic coupling matrix
describing the relationship between q̇ (the time derivatives of the
generalized positions) and the generalized velocities v, [Seth 2010].
``N(q)`` is an ``nq x nv`` matrix. The vector ``τ ∈ ℝⁿᵛ`` on the right
hand side of Eq. (1) is the system's generalized forces. These
incorporate gravity, springs, externally applied body forces,
constraint forces, and contact forces.

**** Discrete system dynamics

We'll start with the basic difference equation interpretation of a
discrete plant and then explain some Drake-specific subtleties.

Note:
    We use "kinematics" here to refer to quantities that involve only
    position or velocity, and "dynamics" to refer to quantities that
    also involve forces.

By default, a discrete MultibodyPlant has these update dynamics:

x[0] = initial kinematics state variables x (={q, v}), s s[0] = empty
(no sample yet)

s[n+1] = g(t[n], x[n], u[n]) record sample x[n+1] = f(t[n], x[n],
u[n]) update kinematics yd[n+1] = gd(s) dynamic outputs use sampled
values yk[n+1] = gk(x) kinematic outputs use current x

Optionally, output port sampling can be disabled. In that case we
have:

x[n+1] = f(t[n], x[n], u[n]) update kinematics yd[n+1] = gd(g(t, x,
u)) dynamic outputs use current values yk[n+1] = gk(x) kinematic
outputs use current x

We're using ``yd`` and ``yk`` above to represent the calculated values
of dynamic and kinematic output ports, resp. Kinematic output ports
are those that depend only on position and velocity: ``state``,
`body_poses`, ``body_spatial_velocities``. Everything else depends on
forces so is a dynamic output port: ``body_spatial_accelerations``,
`generalized_acceleration`, ``net_actuation``, `reaction_forces`, and
``contact_results``.

Use the function SetUseSampledOutputPorts() to choose which dynamics
you prefer. The default behavior (output port sampling) is more
efficient for simulation, but use slightly-different kinematics for
the dynamic output port computations versus the kinematic output
ports. Disabling output port sampling provides "live" output port
results that are recalculated from the current state and inputs
whenever changes occur. It also eliminates the sampling state variable
(s above). Note that kinematic output ports (that is, those depending
only on position and velocity) are always "live" -- they are
calculated as needed from the current (updated) state.

The reason that the default mode is more efficient for simulation is
that the sample variable s records expensive-to-compute results (such
as hydroelastic contact forces) that are needed to advance the state
x. Those results are thus available for free at the start of step n.
If instead we wait until after the state is updated to n+1, we would
have to recalculate those expensive results at the new state in order
to report them. Thus sampling means the output ports show the results
that were calculated using kinematics values x[n], although the
Context has been updated to kinematics values x[n+1]. If that isn't
tolerable you should disable output port sampling. You can also force
an update to occur using ExecuteForcedEvents().

See output_port_sampling "Output port sampling" below for more
practical considerations.

Minor details most users won't care about:

- The sample variable s is a Drake Abstract state variable. When it is
present, the plant update is performed using an Unrestricted update; when it
is absent we are able to use a Discrete update. Some Drake features (e.g.
linearization of discrete systems) may be restricted to systems that use
only Discrete (numeric) state variables and Discrete update.
- The sample variable s is used only by output ports. It does not affect the
behavior of any MultibodyPlant "Calc" or "Eval" functions -- those are
always calculated using the current values of time, kinematic state, and
input port values.

**** Output port sampling

As described in mbp_discrete_dynamics "Discrete system dynamics"
above, the semantics of certain MultibodyPlant output ports depends on
whether the plant is configured to advance using continuous time
integration or discrete time steps (see is_discrete()). This section
explains the details, focusing on the practical aspects moreso than
the equations.

Output ports that only depend on the [q, v] kinematic state (such as
get_body_poses_output_port() or
get_body_spatial_velocities_output_port()) do *not* change semantics
for continuous vs discrete time. In all cases, the output value is a
function of the kinematic state in the context.

Output ports that incorporate dynamics (i.e., forces) *do* change
semantics based on the plant mode. Imagine that the
get_applied_spatial_force_input_port() provides a continuously
time-varying input force. The
get_body_spatial_accelerations_output_port() output is dependent on
that force. We could return a snapshot of the acceleration that was
used in the last time step, or we could recalculate the acceleration
to immediately reflect the changing forces. We call the former a
"sampled" port and the latter a "live" port.

For a continuous-time plant, there is no distinction -- the output
port is always live -- it immediately reflects the instantaneous input
value. It is a "direct feedthrough" output port (see
SystemBase::GetDirectFeedthroughs()).

For a discrete-time plant, the user can choose whether the output
should be sampled or live: Use the function SetUseSampledOutputPorts()
to change whether output ports are sampled or not, and
has_sampled_output_ports() to check the current setting. When sampling
is disabled, the only state in the context is the kinematic [q, v], so
dynamics output ports will always reflect the instantaneous answer
(i.e., direct feedthrough). When sampling is enabled (the default),
the plant state incorporates a snapshot of the most recent step's
kinematics and dynamics, and the output ports will reflect that
sampled state (i.e., not direct feedthrough). For a detailed
discussion, see mbp_discrete_dynamics "Discrete system dynamics".

For a discrete-time plant, the sampled outputs are generally *much*
faster to calculate than the feedthrough outputs when any inputs ports
are changing values faster than the discrete time step, e.g., during a
simulation. When input ports are fixed, or change at the time step
rate (e.g., during motion planning), sampled vs feedthrough will have
similar computational performance.

Direct plant API function calls (e.g.,
EvalBodySpatialAccelerationInWorld()) that depend on forces always use
the instantaneous (not sampled) accelerations.

Here are some practical tips that might help inform your particular
situation:

(1) If you need a minimal-state representation for motion planning,
mathematical optimization, or similar, then you can either use a
continuous-time plant or set the config option
``use_sampled_output_ports=false`` on a discrete-time plant.

(2) By default, setting the positions of a discrete-time plant in the
Context will not have any effect on the dynamics-related output ports,
e.g., the contact results will not change. If you need to see changes
to outputs without running the plant in a Simulator, then you can
either use a continuous-time plant, set the config option
``use_sampled_output_ports=false``, or use ExecuteForcedEvents() to
force a dynamics step and then the outputs (and positions) will
change.

**** Actuation

In a MultibodyPlant model an actuator can be added as a JointActuator,
see AddJointActuator(). The plant declares actuation input ports to
provide feedforward actuation, both for the MultibodyPlant as a whole
(see get_actuation_input_port()) and for each individual
model_instances "model instance" in the MultibodyPlant (see
get_actuation_input_port(ModelInstanceIndex)const
"get_actuation_input_port(ModelInstanceIndex)"). - Actuation inputs
and actuation effort limits are taken to be in joint coordinates (they
are not affected by the actuator gear ratio). - Any actuation input
ports not connected are assumed to be zero. - Actuation values from
the full MultibodyPlant model port (get_actuation_input_port()) and
from the per model-instance ports (
get_actuation_input_port(ModelInstanceIndex)const
"get_actuation_input_port(ModelInstanceIndex)") are summed up.

Note:
    A JointActuator's index into the vector data supplied to
    MultibodyPlant's actuation input port for all actuators
    (get_actuation_input_port()) is given by
    JointActuator::input_start(), NOT by its JointActuatorIndex. That
    is, the vector element data for a JointActuator at index
    JointActuatorIndex(i) in the full input port vector is found at
    index:
    MultibodyPlant::get_joint_actuator(JointActuatorIndex(i)).input_start().
    For the get_actuation_input_port(ModelInstanceIndex)const
    "get_actuation_input_port(ModelInstanceIndex)" specific to a model
    index, the vector data is ordered by monotonically increasing
    JointActuatorIndex for the actuators within that model instance:
    the 0ᵗʰ vector element corresponds to the lowest-numbered
    JointActuatorIndex of that instance, the 1ˢᵗ vector element
    corresponds to the second-lowest-numbered JointActuatorIndex of
    that instance, etc.

Note:
    The following snippet shows how per model instance actuation can
    be set:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    ModelInstanceIndex model_instance_index = ...;
    VectorX<T> u_instance(plant.num_actuated_dofs(model_instance_index));
    int offset = 0;
    for (JointActuatorIndex joint_actuator_index :
    plant.GetJointActuatorIndices(model_instance_index)) {
    const JointActuator<T>& actuator = plant.get_joint_actuator(
    joint_actuator_index);
    const Joint<T>& joint = actuator.joint();
    VectorX<T> u_joint = ... my_actuation_logic_for(joint) ...;
    ASSERT(u_joint.size() == joint_actuator.num_inputs());
    u_instance.segment(offset, u_joint.size()) = u_joint;
    offset += u_joint.size();
    }
    plant.get_actuation_input_port(model_instance_index).FixValue(
    plant_context, u_instance);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Note:
    To inter-operate between the whole plant actuation vector and sets
    of per-model instance actuation vectors, see SetActuationInArray()
    to gather the model instance vectors into a whole plant vector and
    GetActuationFromArray() to scatter the whole plant vector into
    per-model instance vectors.

Warning:
    Effort limits (JointActuator::effort_limit()) are not enforced,
    unless PD controllers are defined. See pd_controllers "Using PD
    controlled actuators".

** Using PD controlled actuators

While PD controllers can be modeled externally and be connected to the
MultibodyPlant model via the get_actuation_input_port(), simulation
stability at discrete-time steps can be compromised for high
controller gains. For such cases, simulation stability and robustness
can be improved significantly by moving your PD controller into the
plant where the discrete solver can strongly couple controller and
model dynamics.

Warning:
    Currently, this feature is only supported for discrete models
    (is_discrete() is true) using the SAP solver
    (get_discrete_contact_solver() returns
    DiscreteContactSolver::kSap.)

PD controlled joint actuators can be defined by setting PD gains for
each joint actuator, see JointActuator::set_controller_gains(). Unless
these gains are specified, joint actuators will not be PD controlled
and JointActuator::has_controller() will return ``False``.

For models with PD controllers, the actuation torque per actuator is
computed according to:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    ũ = -Kp⋅(q − qd) - Kd⋅(v − vd) + u_ff
    u = max(−e, min(e, ũ))

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where qd and vd are desired configuration and velocity (see
get_desired_state_input_port()) for the actuated joint (see
JointActuator::joint()), Kp and Kd are the proportional and derivative
gains of the actuator (see JointActuator::get_controller_gains()),
``u_ff`` is the feed-forward actuation specified with
get_actuation_input_port(), and ``e`` corresponds to effort limit (see
JointActuator::effort_limit()).

Notice that actuation through get_actuation_input_port() and PD
control are not mutually exclusive, and they can be used together.
This is better explained through examples: 1. **PD controlled
gripper**. In this case, only PD control is used to drive the opening
and closing of the fingers. The feed-forward term is assumed to be
zero and the actuation input port is not required to be connected. 2.
**Robot arm**. A typical configuration consists on applying gravity
compensation in the feed-forward term plus PD control to drive the
robot to a given desired state.

** Actuation input ports requirements

Actuation input ports and desired state input ports need not be
connected: - Unconnected actuation inputs default to zero, simplifying
diagram wiring for models relying solely on PD controllers. - PD
controllers are disarmed when their model instance's desired state
input port is disconnected. In this state, they have no effect on
dynamics, behaving as if no PD controller exists. This allows a
MultibodyPlant model to be used outside simulation (e.g., for
visualization).

Note that both ports are always created but will be zero-sized for
model instances without actuation.

** Net actuation

The total joint actuation applied via the actuation input port
(get_actuation_input_port()) and applied by the PD controllers is
reported by the net actuation port (get_net_actuation_output_port()).
That is, the net actuation port reports the total actuation applied by
a given actuator.

Note:
    PD controllers are ignored when a joint is locked (see
    Joint::Lock()), and thus they have no effect on the actuation
    output.

**** Loading models from SDFormat files

Drake has the capability to load multibody models from SDFormat and
URDF files. Consider the example below which loads an acrobot model:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    MultibodyPlant<T> acrobot;
    SceneGraph<T> scene_graph;
    Parser parser(&acrobot, &scene_graph);
    const std::string url =
    "package://drake/multibody/benchmarks/acrobot/acrobot.sdf";
    parser.AddModelsFromUrl(url);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

As in the example above, for models including visual geometry,
collision geometry or both, the user must specify a SceneGraph for
geometry handling. You can find a full example of the LQR controlled
acrobot in examples/multibody/acrobot/run_lqr.cc.

AddModelFromFile() can be invoked multiple times on the same plant in
order to load multiple model instances. Other methods are available on
Parser such as AddModels() which allows creating model instances per
each ``<model>`` tag found in the file. Please refer to each of these
methods' documentation for further details.

**** Working with SceneGraph

** Adding a MultibodyPlant connected to a SceneGraph to your Diagram

Probably the simplest way to add and wire up a MultibodyPlant with a
SceneGraph in your Diagram is using AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph().

Recommended usages:

Assign to a MultibodyPlant reference (ignoring the SceneGraph):


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    MultibodyPlant<double>& plant =
    AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(&builder, 0.0 /+ time_step +/);
    plant.DoFoo(...);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

This flavor is the simplest, when the SceneGraph is not explicitly
needed. (It can always be retrieved later via
GetSubsystemByName("scene_graph").)

Assign to auto, and use the named public fields:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    auto items = AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(&builder, 0.0 /+ time_step +/);
    items.plant.DoFoo(...);
    items.scene_graph.DoBar(...);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

or taking advantage of C++'s structured binding:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    auto [plant, scene_graph] = AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(&builder, 0.0);
    ...
    plant.DoFoo(...);
    scene_graph.DoBar(...);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

This is the easiest way to use both the plant and scene_graph.

Assign to already-declared pointer variables:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    MultibodyPlant<double>* plant{};
    SceneGraph<double>* scene_graph{};
    std::tie(plant, scene_graph) =
    AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph(&builder, 0.0 /+ time_step +/);
    plant->DoFoo(...);
    scene_graph->DoBar(...);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

This flavor is most useful when the pointers are class member fields
(and so perhaps cannot be references).

** Registering geometry with a SceneGraph

MultibodyPlant users can register geometry with a SceneGraph for
essentially two purposes; a) visualization and, b) contact modeling.

Before any geometry registration takes place, a user **must** first
make a call to RegisterAsSourceForSceneGraph() in order to register
the MultibodyPlant as a client of a SceneGraph instance, point at
which the plant will have assigned a valid geometry::SourceId. At
Finalize(), MultibodyPlant will declare input/output ports as
appropriate to communicate with the SceneGraph instance on which
registrations took place. All geometry registration **must** be
performed pre-finalize.

Multibodyplant declares an input port for geometric queries, see
get_geometry_query_input_port(). If MultibodyPlant registers geometry
with a SceneGraph via calls to RegisterCollisionGeometry(), users may
use this port for geometric queries. The port must be connected to the
same SceneGraph used for registration. The preferred mechanism is to
use AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph() as documented above.

In extraordinary circumstances, this can be done by hand and the setup
process will include:

1. Call to RegisterAsSourceForSceneGraph().
2. Calls to RegisterCollisionGeometry(), as many as needed.
3. Call to Finalize(), user is done specifying the model.
4. Connect geometry::SceneGraph::get_query_output_port() to
get_geometry_query_input_port().
5. Connect get_geometry_pose_output_port() to
geometry::SceneGraph::get_source_pose_port()

Refer to the documentation provided in each of the methods above for
further details.

** Accessing point contact parameters MultibodyPlant's point contact
model looks for model parameters stored as
geometry::ProximityProperties by geometry::SceneGraph. These
properties can be obtained before or after context creation through
geometry::SceneGraphInspector APIs as outlined below. MultibodyPlant
expects the following properties for point contact modeling:

|Group name|Property Name|Required|Property Type|Property Description|
|:--------:|:-----------:|:------:|:----------------:|:-------------------|
|material|coulomb_friction|yes¹|CoulombFriction<T>|Static and Dynamic
friction.| |material|point_contact_stiffness|no²|T| Compliant point
contact stiffness.| |material|hunt_crossley_dissipation |no²⁴|T|
Compliant contact dissipation.|
|material|relaxation_time|yes³⁴|T|Linear Kelvin–Voigt model
parameter.|

¹ Collision geometry is required to be registered with a
geometry::ProximityProperties object that contains the ("material",
"coulomb_friction") property. If the property is missing,
MultibodyPlant will throw an exception.

² If the property is missing, MultibodyPlant will use a heuristic
value as the default. Refer to the section point_contact_defaults
"Point Contact Default Parameters" for further details.

³ When using a linear Kelvin–Voigt model of dissipation (for instance
when selecting the SAP solver), collision geometry is required to be
registered with a geometry::ProximityProperties object that contains
the ("material", "relaxation_time") property. If the property is
missing, an exception will be thrown.

⁴ We allow to specify both hunt_crossley_dissipation and
relaxation_time for a given geometry. However only one of these will
get used, depending on the configuration of the MultibodyPlant. As an
example, if the SAP contact approximation is specified (see
set_discrete_contact_approximation()) only the relaxation_time is used
while hunt_crossley_dissipation is ignored. Conversely, if the TAMSI,
Similar or Lagged approximation is used (see
set_discrete_contact_approximation()) only hunt_crossley_dissipation
is used while relaxation_time is ignored. Currently, a continuous
MultibodyPlant model will always use the Hunt & Crossley model and
relaxation_time will be ignored.

Accessing and modifying contact properties requires interfacing with
geometry::SceneGraph's model inspector. Interfacing with a model
inspector obtained from geometry::SceneGraph will provide the default
registered values for a given parameter. These are the values that
will initially appear in a systems::Context created by
CreateDefaultContext(). Subsequently, true system parameters can be
accessed and changed through a systems::Context once available. For
both of the above cases, proximity properties are accessed through
geometry::SceneGraphInspector APIs.

Before context creation an inspector can be retrieved directly from
SceneGraph as:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    // For a SceneGraph<T> instance called scene_graph.
    const geometry::SceneGraphInspector<T>& inspector =
    scene_graph.model_inspector();

.. raw:: html

    </details>

After context creation, an inspector can be retrieved from the state
stored in the context:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    // For a MultibodyPlant<T> instance called mbp and a Context<T> called
    // context.
    const geometry::SceneGraphInspector<T>& inspector =
    mbp.EvalSceneGraphInspector(context);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Once an inspector is available, proximity properties can be retrieved
as:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    // For a body with GeometryId called geometry_id
    const geometry::ProximityProperties* props =
    inspector.GetProximityProperties(geometry_id);
    const CoulombFriction<T>& geometry_friction =
    props->GetProperty<CoulombFriction<T>>("material",
    "coulomb_friction");

    </details>

**** Working with MultibodyElement parameters Several
MultibodyElements expose parameters, allowing the user flexible
modification of some aspects of the plant's model, post
systems::Context creation. For details, refer to the documentation for
the MultibodyElement whose parameters you are trying to modify/access
(e.g. RigidBody, FixedOffsetFrame, etc.)

As an example, here is how to access and modify rigid body mass
parameters:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    MultibodyPlant<double> plant;
    // ... Code to add bodies, finalize plant, and to obtain a context.
    const RigidBody<double>& body =
    plant.GetRigidBodyByName("BodyName");
    const SpatialInertia<double> M_BBo_B =
    body.GetSpatialInertiaInBodyFrame(context);
    // .. logic to determine a new SpatialInertia parameter for body.
    const SpatialInertia<double>& M_BBo_B_new = ....
    
    // Modify the body parameter for spatial inertia.
    body.SetSpatialInertiaInBodyFrame(&context, M_BBo_B_new);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Another example, working with automatic differentiation in order to
take derivatives with respect to one of the bodies' masses:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    MultibodyPlant<double> plant;
    // ... Code to add bodies, finalize plant, and to obtain a
    // context and a body's spatial inertia M_BBo_B.
    
    // Scalar convert the plant.
    unique_ptr<MultibodyPlant<AutoDiffXd>> plant_autodiff =
    systems::System<double>::ToAutoDiffXd(plant);
    unique_ptr<Context<AutoDiffXd>> context_autodiff =
    plant_autodiff->CreateDefaultContext();
    context_autodiff->SetTimeStateAndParametersFrom(context);
    
    const RigidBody<AutoDiffXd>& body =
    plant_autodiff->GetRigidBodyByName("BodyName");
    
    // Modify the body parameter for mass.
    const AutoDiffXd mass_autodiff(mass, Vector1d(1));
    body.SetMass(context_autodiff.get(), mass_autodiff);
    
    // M_autodiff(i, j).derivatives()(0), contains the derivatives of
    // M(i, j) with respect to the body's mass.
    MatrixX<AutoDiffXd> M_autodiff(plant_autodiff->num_velocities(),
    plant_autodiff->num_velocities());
    plant_autodiff->CalcMassMatrix(*context_autodiff, &M_autodiff);

    </details>

**** Adding modeling elements

Add multibody elements to a MultibodyPlant with methods like:

- Bodies: AddRigidBody()
- Joints: AddJoint()
- see mbp_construction "Construction" for more.

All modeling elements **must** be added before Finalize() is called.
See mbp_finalize_stage "Finalize stage" for a discussion.

**** Modeling contact

Please refer to drake_contacts "Contact Modeling in Drake" for details
on the available approximations, setup, and considerations for a
multibody simulation with frictional contact.

**** Energy and Power

MultibodyPlant implements the System energy and power methods, with
some limitations. - Kinetic energy: fully implemented. - Potential
energy and conservative power: currently include only gravity and
contributions from ForceElement objects; potential energy from
compliant contact and joint limits are not included. - Nonconservative
power: currently includes only contributions from ForceElement
objects; actuation and input port forces, joint damping, and
dissipation from joint limits, friction, and contact dissipation are
not included.

See Drake issue #12942 for more discussion.

**** Finalize() stage

Once the user is done adding modeling elements and registering
geometry, a call to Finalize() must be performed. This call will: -
Build the underlying tree structure of the multibody model, - declare
the plant's state, - declare the plant's input and output ports, -
declare collision filters to ignore collisions among rigid bodies: -
between rigid bodies connected by a joint, - within subgraphs of
welded rigid bodies.

Note that MultibodyPlant will *not* introduce any automatic collision
filters on deformable bodies. Collision filters for deformable bodies
can be explicitly applied via
ExcludeCollisionGeometriesWithCollisionFilterGroupPair() or during
parsing.

This constraint can be compliant, modeling a spring with free length
``distance`` and given ``stiffness`` and ``damping`` parameters
between points P and Q. For d = ‖p_PQ‖, then a compliant distance
constraint models a spring with force along p_PQ given by:

f = −stiffness ⋅ d − damping ⋅ ḋ

Parameter ``body_A``:
    RigidBody to which point P is rigidly attached.

Parameter ``p_AP``:
    Position of point P in body A's frame.

Parameter ``body_B``:
    RigidBody to which point Q is rigidly attached.

Parameter ``p_BQ``:

Parameter ``distance``:
    Fixed length of the distance constraint, in meters. It must be
    strictly positive.

Parameter ``stiffness``:
    For modeling a spring with free length equal to ``distance``, the
    stiffness parameter in N/m. Optional, with its default value being
    infinite to model a rigid massless rod of length ``distance``
    connecting points A and B.

Parameter ``damping``:

    damping parameter in N⋅s/m. Optional, with its default value being

Warning:
    Currently, it is the user's responsibility to initialize the

Warning:
    A distance constraint is the wrong modeling choice if the distance
    needs to go through zero. To constrain two points to be coincident
    we need a 3-dof ball constraint, the 1-dof distance constraint is
    singular in this case. Therefore we require the distance parameter
    to be strictly positive.

For finite ``stiffness`` and ``damping``, this constraint is modeled
by compliant spring-like forces:

fₗ = −stiffness⋅(l - lₗ) − damping⋅dl(q)/dt

fᵤ = −stiffness⋅(lᵤ - l) + damping⋅dl(q)/dt

that act to keep the length within bounds. If the user provided
stiffness is either omitted or set to ∞, this constraint is modeled as
close to rigid as possible by the underlying solver.

Note:
    The coefficients in a are expected to have units such that the
    abstract length l(q) has consistent units (either meters or
    radians) and it is up to the user to maintain consistency in these
    units. The (optionally user provided) ``stiffness`` and
    ``damping`` are expected to have consistent units such that their
    products have units of the corresponding generalized force. E.g.
    N/m for ``stiffness`` and N⋅s/m for ``damping`` when l has units
    of m, so that **fₗ** and **fᵤ** have units of N.

Note:
    Any joint involved in this constraint can still be actuated.

Parameter ``joints``:
    Non-empty vector of single-dof joint indices where the
    configuration, qᵢ, of joints[i] corresponds to the entry a[i].

Parameter ``a``:
    Non-empty vector of coefficients where a[i] corresponds to the
    configuration, qᵢ, of joints[i].

Parameter ``offset``:
    (optional) Scalar length offset in either [m] or [rad]. If
    std::nullopt, it is set to 0.

Parameter ``lower_limit``:
    (optional) Lower bound on l in either [m] or [rad]. If
    std::nullopt, it is set to −∞.

Parameter ``upper_limit``:
    Upper bound on l in either [m] or [rad]. If std::nullopt, it is
    set to ∞.

Parameter ``stiffness``:
    (optional) Constraint stiffness in either [N/m] or [N⋅m/rad]. If
    std::nullopt, its default value is set to ∞ to model a rigid
    constraint.

Parameter ``damping``:
    (optional) Constraint damping in either [N⋅s/m] or [N⋅m⋅rad/s]. If
    std::nullopt, it is set to 0 to model a non-dissipative
    constraint.

Warning:
    Because of a restriction in the SAP solver, **at most** two

consists of a vector applied generalized forces. The last term is a

R"""(This constructor creates a plant with a single "world" body.
Therefore, right after creation, num_bodies() returns one.

MultibodyPlant offers two different modalities to model mechanical
systems in time. These are: 1. As a discrete system with periodic
updates, ``time_step`` is strictly greater than zero. 2. As a
continuous system, ``time_step`` equals exactly zero.

Currently the discrete model is preferred for simulation given its
robustness and speed in problems with frictional contact. However this
might change as we work towards developing better strategies to model
contact. See multibody_simulation for further details.

Warning:
    Users should be aware of current limitations in either modeling
    modality. While the discrete model is often the preferred option
    for problems with frictional contact given its robustness and
    speed, it might become unstable when using large feedback gains,
    high damping or large external forcing. MultibodyPlant will throw
    an exception whenever the discrete solver is detected to fail.
    Conversely, the continuous modality has the potential to leverage
    the robustness and accuracy control provide by Drake's
    integrators. However thus far this has proved difficult in
    practice and especially due to poor performance.

Parameter ``time_step``:
    Indicates whether ``this`` plant is modeled as a continuous system
    (``time_step = 0``) or as a discrete system with periodic updates
    of period ``time_step > 0``. See multibody_simulation for further
    details.

Warning:
    Currently the continuous modality with ``time_step = 0`` does not
    support joint limits for simulation, these are ignored.
    MultibodyPlant prints a warning to console if joint limits are
    provided. If your simulation requires joint limits currently you
    must use a discrete MultibodyPlant model.

Note:

Note:
    The desired state input port for a given model instance is not

R"""(**** Stribeck model of friction

Currently MultibodyPlant uses the Stribeck approximation to model dry
friction. The Stribeck model of friction is an approximation to
Coulomb's law of friction that allows using continuous time
integration without the need to specify complementarity constraints.
While this results in a simpler model immediately tractable with
standard numerical methods for integration of ODE's, it often leads to
stiff dynamics that require an explicit integrator to take very small
time steps. It is therefore recommended to use error controlled
integrators when using this model or the discrete time stepping (see
multibody_simulation). See stribeck_approximation for a detailed
discussion of the Stribeck model.

Sets the stiction tolerance ``v_stiction`` for the Stribeck model,
where ``v_stiction`` must be specified in m/s (meters per second.)
``v_stiction`` defaults to a value of 1 millimeter per second. In
selecting a value for ``v_stiction``, you must ask yourself the
question, "When two objects are ostensibly in stiction, how much slip
am I willing to allow?" There are two opposing design issues in
picking a value for vₛ. On the one hand, small values of vₛ make the
problem numerically stiff during stiction, potentially increasing the
integration cost. On the other hand, it should be picked to be
appropriate for the scale of the problem. For example, a car
simulation could allow a "large" value for vₛ of 1 cm/s (1×10⁻² m/s),
but reasonable stiction for grasping a 10 cm box might require
limiting residual slip to 1×10⁻³ m/s or less. Ultimately, picking the
largest viable value will allow your simulation to run faster and more
robustly. Note that ``v_stiction`` is the slip velocity that we'd have
when we are at edge of the friction cone. For cases when the friction
force is well within the friction cone the slip velocity will always
be smaller than this value. See also stribeck_approximation.

    q̇ = N(q) v
    (1)  M(q) v̇ = τ + Jₙᵀ(q) fₙ(q, v) + Jₜᵀ(q) fₜ(q, v)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where ``v ∈ ℝⁿᵛ`` is the vector of generalized velocities, ``M(q) ∈
ℝⁿᵛˣⁿᵛ`` is the mass matrix, ``Jₙ(q) ∈ ℝⁿᶜˣⁿᵛ`` is the Jacobian of
normal separation velocities, ``Jₜ(q) ∈ ℝ²ⁿᶜˣⁿᵛ`` is the Jacobian of
tangent velocities, ``fₙ ∈ ℝⁿᶜ`` is the vector of normal contact
forces, ``fₜ ∈ ℝ²ⁿᶜ`` is the vector of tangent friction forces and τ ∈
ℝⁿᵛ is a vector of generalized forces containing all other applied
forces (e.g., Coriolis, gyroscopic terms, actuator forces, etc.) but
contact forces. This solver assumes a compliant law for the normal
forces ``fₙ(q, v)`` and therefore the functional dependence of ``fₙ(q,
v)`` with q and v is stated explicitly.

Since TamsiSolver uses regularized friction, we explicitly emphasize
the functional dependence of ``fₜ(q, v)`` with the generalized
velocities. The functional dependence of ``fₜ(q, v)`` with the
generalized positions stems from its direct dependence with the normal
forces ``fₙ(q, v)``.

TamsiSolver implements two different schemes. A "one-way coupling
scheme" which solves for the friction forces given the normal forces
are known. That is, normal forces affect the computation of the
friction forces however, the normal forces are kept constant during
the solution procedure.

A "two-way coupling scheme" treats both the normal and friction forces
implicitly in the generalized velocities resulting in a numerical
strategy in which normal forces affect friction forces and,
conversely, friction forces couple back to the computation of the
normal forces.

The two-way coupled scheme provides a more stable and therefore robust
solution to the problem stated in Eq. (1) with just a small increase
of the computational cost compared to the one-way coupled scheme. The
one-way coupled scheme is however very useful for testing and analysis
of the solver.

One-Way Coupling Scheme
-----------------------

Equation (1) is discretized in time using a variation of the first
order semi-implicit Euler scheme from step s to step s+1 with time
step ``δt`` as:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    qˢ⁺¹ = qˢ + δt N(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹
    (2)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ =
    M(qˢ) vˢ + δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(qˢ,vˢ⁺¹)]

.. raw:: html

    </details>

(We are using s for step counter rather than n to avoid
Unicode-induced confusion with the "normal direction" subscript n.)

Please see details in the one_way_coupling_derivation "Derivation of
the one-way coupling scheme" section. The equation for the generalized
velocities in Eq. (2) is rewritten as:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (3)  M vˢ⁺¹ = p* + δt [Jₙᵀ fₙ + Jₜᵀ fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)]

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where ``p* = M vˢ + δt τˢ`` is the generalized momentum that the
system would have in the absence of contact forces and, for
simplicity, we have only kept the functional dependencies in
generalized velocities. Notice that TamsiSolver uses a precomputed
value of the normal forces. These normal forces could be available for
instance if using a compliant contact approach, for which normal
forces are a function of the state.

Two-Way Coupling Scheme
-----------------------

Equation (1) is discretized in time using a variation on the
semi-implicit Euler scheme with time step ``δt`` as:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    qˢ⁺¹ = qˢ + δt N(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹
    (4)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
    δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙˢ⁺¹ + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(fₙˢ⁺¹,vₜˢ⁺¹)]

.. raw:: html

    </details>

This implicit scheme variation evaluates Jacobian matrices Jₙ and Jₜ
as well as the kinematic mapping N(q) at the previous time step. In
Eq. (4) we have fₙˢ⁺¹ = fₙ(xˢ⁺¹, vₙˢ⁺¹) with xˢ⁺¹ = x(qˢ⁺¹), the
signed *penetration* distance (defined positive when bodies overlap)
between contact point pairs and the *separation* velocities vₙˢ⁺¹ =
Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ (= −ẋˢ⁺¹). Also the functional dependence of fₜ with fₙ
and vₜ is highlighted in Eq. (4). More precisely, the two-way coupling
scheme uses a normal force law for each contact pair of the form:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (5)  fₙ(x, vₙ) = k(vₙ)₊ x₊
    (6)      k(vₙ) = k (1 − d vₙ)₊

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where ``x₊`` is the positive part of x (x₊ = x if x ≥ 0 and x₊ = 0
otherwise) and ``k`` and d are the stiffness and dissipation
coefficients for a given contact point, respectively.

The two-way coupling scheme uses a first order approximation to the
signed distance functions vector:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (7)  xˢ⁺¹ ≈ xˢ − δt vₙˢ⁺¹ =  xˢ − δt Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where the minus sign is needed given that ẋ = dx/dt = −vₙ. This
approximation is used in Eq. (5) to obtain a numerical scheme that
implicitly couples normal forces through their functional dependence
on the signed penetration distance. Notice that, according to Eq. (5),
normal forces at each contact point are decoupled from each other.
However their values are coupled given the choice of a common
variable, the generalized velocity v.

Equation (7) is used into Eq. (5) to obtain an expression of the
normal force in terms of the generalized velocity vˢ⁺¹ at the next
time step:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (8) fₙ(xˢ⁺¹, vₙˢ⁺¹) = k (1 − d vₙˢ⁺¹)₊ xˢ⁺¹₊
    = k (1 − d Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹)₊ (xˢ − δt Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹)₊
    = fₙ(vˢ⁺¹)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Similarly, the friction forces fₜ can be written in terms of the next
time step generalized velocities using vₜˢ⁺¹ = Jₜ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ and using
Eq. (8) to substitute an expression for the normal force in terms of
vˢ⁺¹. This allows to re-write the tangential forces as a function of
the generalized velocities as:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (9)  fₜ(fₙˢ⁺¹, vₜˢ⁺¹) = fₜ(fₙ(x(vˢ⁺¹), vₙ(vˢ⁺¹)), vₜ((vˢ⁺¹)))
    = fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where we write x(vˢ⁺¹) = xˢ − δt Jₙ(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹. Finally, Eqs. (8) and
(9) are used into Eq. (4) to obtain an expression in vˢ⁺¹:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (10)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = p* + δt [Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(vˢ⁺¹) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)]

.. raw:: html

    </details>

with p* = ``p* = M vˢ + δt τˢ`` the generalized momentum that the
system would have in the absence of contact forces.

TamsiSolver uses a Newton-Raphson strategy to solve Eq. (10) in the
generalized velocities, limiting the iteration update with the scheme
described in iteration_limiter.

Limits in the Iteration Updates
-------------------------------

TamsiSolver solves for the generalized velocity at the next time step
``vˢ⁺¹`` with either a one-way or two-way coupled scheme as described
in the previous sections. The solver uses a Newton-Raphson iteration
to compute an update ``Δvᵏ`` at the k-th Newton-Raphson iteration.
Once ``Δvᵏ`` is computed, the solver limits the change in the
tangential velocities ``Δvₜᵏ = Jₜᵀ Δvᵏ`` using the approach described
in uchida_etal_2015 "[Uchida et al., 2015]". This approach limits the
maximum angle change θ between two successive iterations in the
tangential velocity. Details of our implementation are provided in
castro_etal_2019 "[Castro et al., 2019]".

Derivation of the one-way coupling scheme
-----------------------------------------

In this section we provide a detailed derivation of the first order
time stepping approach in Eq. (2). We start from the continuous Eq.
(1):


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (1)  M(q) v̇ = τ + Jₙᵀ(q) fₙ(q,v) + Jₜᵀ(q) fₜ(q,v)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

we can discretize Eq. (1) in time using a first order semi-implicit
Euler scheme in velocities:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (11)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
    δt [τˢ⁺¹ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(qˢ,vˢ⁺¹) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)] + O₁(δt²)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where the equality holds strictly since we included the leading terms
in ``O(δt²)``. We use ``τˢ⁺¹ = τ(tˢ, qˢ, vˢ⁺¹)`` for brevity in Eq.
(11). When moving from the continuous Eq. (1) to the discrete version
Eq. (11), we lost the nice property that our compliant normal forces
are decoupled from the friction forces (both depend on the same
unknown vˢ⁺¹ in Eq (11)). The reason is that Eq. (11) includes an
integration over a small interval of size δt. To solve the discrete
system in Eq. (11), we'd like to decouple the normal forces from the
tangential forces again, which will require a new (though still valid)
approximation. To do so we will expand in Taylor series the term
``fₙ(qˢ, vˢ⁺¹)``:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (12)  fₙ(qˢ, vˢ⁺¹) = fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + ∇ᵥfₙ(qˢ,vˢ) (vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ) + O₂(‖vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ‖²)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

The difference between ``vˢ`` and ``vˢ⁺¹`` can be written as:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (13)  vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ = δtv̇ˢ + δtO₃(δt²) = O₄(δt)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Substituting ``vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ`` from Eq. (13) into Eq. (12) we arrive to:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (14)  fₙ(qˢ, vˢ⁺¹) = fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + ∇ᵥfₙ(qˢ,vˢ) O₄(δt) + O₅(δt²)
    = fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + O₆(δt)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where ``O₅(δt²) = O₂(‖vˢ⁺¹ − vˢ‖²) = O₂(‖O₄(δt)‖²)``. A similar
argument for τˢ⁺¹ shows it also differs in O(δt) from τˢ = τ(tˢ, qˢ,
vˢ). We can now use Eq. (14) into Eq. (11) to arrive to:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (15)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
    δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) (fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + O₆(δt)) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)] +
    O₁(δt²)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

which we can rewrite as:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (16)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
    δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(qˢ, vˢ) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)] + O₇(δt²)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

with ``O₇(δt²) = δt Jₙᵀ(qˢ) O₆(δt) + O₁(δt²)``. That is, Eq. (16)
introduces the same order of approximation as in the semi-implicit
method in Eq. (11). Up to this point we have made no approximations
but we instead propagated the ``O(⋅)`` leading terms. Therefore the
equalities in the equations above are exact. To obtain an approximate
time stepping scheme, we drop ``O₇(δt²)`` (we neglect it) in Eq. (16)
to arrive to a first order scheme:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    (17)  M(qˢ) vˢ⁺¹ = M(qˢ) vˢ +
    δt [τˢ + Jₙᵀ(qˢ) fₙ(qˢ,vˢ) + Jₜᵀ(qˢ) fₜ(vˢ⁺¹)]

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Therefore, with the scheme in Eq. (17) we are able to decouple the
computation of (compliant) normal forces from that of friction forces.
A very important feature of this scheme however, is the explicit
nature (in the velocities v) of the term associated with the normal
forces (usually including dissipation in the normal direction), which
will become unstable for a sufficiently large time step. However, for
most applications in practice, the stability of the scheme is mostly
determined by the explicit update of normal forces with positions,
that is, Eq. (17) is explicit in positions through the normal forces
``fₙ(qˢ, vˢ)``. For many common applications, the explicit dependence
of ``τˢ(tˢ, qˢ, vˢ)`` on the previous time step velocities ``vˢ``
determines the overall stability of the scheme, since this term can
include velocity dependent contributions such as control forces and
dampers. Notice that Eq. (12) introduces an expansion of ``fₙ`` with
an order of approximation consistent with the first order scheme as
needed. Therefore, it propagates into a ``O(δt²)`` term exactly as
needed in Eq. (16).

This model was also empirically validated for a bird-scale UAV with

Rick Cory and Russ Tedrake, "Experiments in Fixed-Wing UAV Perching",
