R"""(This class represents a *spatial acceleration* A and has 6 elements
with an angular (rotational) acceleration Œ± (3-element vector) on top
of a translational (linear) acceleration ùêö (3-element vector). Spatial
acceleration represents the rotational and translational acceleration
of a frame B with respect to a *measured-in* frame M. This class
assumes that both the angular acceleration Œ± and translational
acceleration ùêö are expressed in the same *expressed-in* frame E. This
class only stores 6 elements (namely Œ± and ùêö) and does not store the
underlying frames B, M, E. The user is responsible for explicitly
tracking the underlying frames with multibody_quantities "monogram
notation". For example, A_MB_E denotes frame B's spatial acceleration
measured in frame M, expressed in frame E and contains alpha_MB_E (B's
angular acceleration measured in M, expressed in E) and a_MBo_E (Bo's
translational acceleration measured in M, expressed in E), where Bo is
frame B's origin point. For an multibody_frames_and_bodies "offset
frame" Bp, the monogram notation A_MBp_E denotes frame Bp's spatial
acceleration measured in M, expressed in E. Details on spatial vectors
and monogram notation are in sections multibody_spatial_vectors and
multibody_quantities.

The typeset for A_MB is :math:`\,{^MA^B}` and its definition is
:math:`^MA^B = \frac{^Md}{dt}\,{^MV^B}\,`, where :math:`{^MV^B}` is
frame B's spatial velocity in frame M and :math:`\frac{^Md}{dt}`
denotes the time derivative taken in frame M. To differentiate a
vector, we need to specify in what frame the time derivative is taken,
see [Mitiguy 2022, ¬ß7.2] for an in-depth discussion. Time derivatives
in different frames are related by the "Transport Theorem", which in
Drake is implemented in
drake::math::ConvertTimeDerivativeToOtherFrame(). In source code
(monogram) notation, we write A_MB = DtM(V_MB), where DtM() denotes
the time derivative in frame M. Details on vector differentiation is
in section Dt_multibody_quantities.

If frame C is rigidly fixed to frame B, A_BC_E = 0 and V_BC_E = 0 and
this method produces a Shift() operation (albeit inefficiently). The
previous equations show composing spatial acceleration is not simply
adding A_MB + A_BC and these equations differ significantly from their
spatial velocity counterparts. For example, angular velocities simply
add as
