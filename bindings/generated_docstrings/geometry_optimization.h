the affine hull of each factor individually; ``tol`` is propagated to
the constituent calls. (This is not done if the Cartesian product has
an associated affine transformation.) - Hyperellipsoid: Always equal
to the whole ambient space; ``tol`` is ignored. - Hyperrectangle: Can
be computed in closed-form; ``tol`` has the same meaning as in the
generic affine hull computation. - Point: Can be computed in

obviously a singleton point, as determined via MaybeGetPoint. -

Note:
    this method is intended to be used for low to moderate dimensions
    (d<15). For larger dimensions, a telescopic product approach has
    yet to be implemented. See, e.g.,
    https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/chevallier22a/chevallier22a.pdf

Parameter ``generator``:
    a random number generator.

Parameter ``desired_rel_accuracy``:
    the desired relative accuracy of the volume estimate in the sense
    that the estimated volume is likely to be within the interval
    defined by (1±2*desired_rel_accuracy)*true_volume with probability
    of at least* 0.95 according to the Law of Large Numbers.
    https://people.math.umass.edu/~lr7q/ps_files/teaching/math456/Chapter6.pdf
    The computation will terminate when the relative error is less
    than rel_accuracy or when the maximum number of samples is
    reached.

Parameter ``max_num_samples``:
    the maximum number of samples to use.

Precondition:
    ``desired_rel_accuracy`` is in the range [0,1].

Returns:
    a pair the estimated volume of the set and an upper bound for the
    relative accuracy

Raises:
    if ambient_dimension() == 0.

Raises:
    if the minimum axis-aligned bounding box of the set cannot be
    computed.)""";

Warning:
    This feature is considered to be **experimental** and may change
    or be removed at any time, without any deprecation notice ahead of
    time.

Each vertex in the graph is associated with a convex set over
continuous variables, edges in the graph contain convex costs and
constraints on these continuous variables. We can then formulate
optimization problems over this graph, such as the shortest path
problem where each visit to a vertex also corresponds to selecting an
element from the convex set subject to the costs and constraints.
Behind the scenes, we construct efficient mixed-integer convex
transcriptions of the graph problem using MathematicalProgram.
However, we provide the option to solve an often tight convex
relaxation of the problem with
GraphOfConvexSetsOptions::convex_relaxation and employ a cheap
rounding stage which solves the convex restriction along potential
paths to find a feasible solution to the original problem.

Design note: This class avoids providing any direct access to the
MathematicalProgram that it constructs nor to the decision variables /
constraints. The users should be able to write constraints against
"placeholder" decision variables on the vertices and edges, but these
get translated in non-trivial ways to the underlying program.

**Advanced Usage: Guiding Non-convex Optimization with the
GraphOfConvexSets**

Solving a GCS problem using convex relaxation involves two components:
- Convex Relaxation: The relaxation of the binary variables (edge
activations) and perspective operations on the convex cost/constraints
leads to a convex problem that considers the graph as a whole. -
Rounding: After solving the relaxation, a randomized rounding scheme
is applied to obtain a feasible solution for the original problem. We
interpret the relaxed flow variables as edge probabilities to guide
the maximum likelyhood depth first search from the source to target
vertices. Each rounding is calling SolveConvexRestriction.

To handle non-convex constraints, one can provide convex surrogates to
the relaxation and the true non-convex constraints to the rounding
problem. These surrogates approximate the non-convex constraints,
making the relaxation solvable as a convex optimization to guide the
non-convex rounding. This can be controlled by the Transcription enum
in the AddConstraint method. We encourage users to provide a strong
convex surrogate, when possible, to better approximate the original
non-convex problem.

Users can also specify a GCS implicitly, which can be important for
very large or infinite graphs, by deriving from
ImplicitGraphOfConvexSets.)""";

algorithm, as described in

R. L. H. Deits and R. Tedrake, “Computing large convex regions of
obstacle-free space through semidefinite programming,” Workshop on the
Algorithmic Fundamentals of Robotics, Istanbul, Aug. 2014.
http://groups.csail.mit.edu/robotics-center/public_papers/Deits14.pdf

This algorithm attempts to locally maximize the volume of a convex
polytope representing obstacle-free space given a sample point and
list of convex obstacles. Rather than compute the volume of the
polytope directly, the algorithm maximizes the volume of an inscribed
ellipsoid. It alternates between finding separating hyperplanes
between the ellipsoid and the obstacles and then finding a new
maximum-volume inscribed ellipsoid.

Parameter ``obstacles``:
    is a vector of convex sets representing the occupied space.

Parameter ``sample``:
    provides a point in the space; the algorithm is initialized using
    a tiny sphere around this point. The algorithm is only guaranteed
    to succeed if this sample point is collision free (outside of all
    obstacles), but in practice the algorithm can often escape bad
    initialization (assuming the require_sample_point_is_contained
    option is false).

Parameter ``domain``:
    describes the total region of interest; computed IRIS regions will
    be inside this domain. It must be bounded, and is typically a
    simple bounding box (e.g. from HPolyhedron::MakeBox).

The ``obstacles``, ``sample``, and the ``domain`` must describe
elements in the same ambient dimension (but that dimension can be any
positive integer).

Note:
    Some members of ``options`` are only applicable to IrisNp. The
    members relevant for this function are starting_ellipse,
    termination_func, bounding_region, verify_domain_boundedness,
    require_sample_point_is_contained, iteration_limit,

    collisions in configuration space; each potential collision is
    probabilistically "certified" by restarting the nonlinear
    optimization from random initial seeds inside the candidate IRIS
    region until it fails to find a collision in

This method constructs a single Iris region in the configuration space
of ``plant``.

See also:
    planning::IrisInConfigurationSpaceFromCliqueCover for a method to
    automatically cover the configuration space with multiple Iris
    regions.

Parameter ``plant``:
    describes the kinematics of configuration space. It must be
    connected to a SceneGraph in a systems::Diagram.

Parameter ``context``:
    is a context of the ``plant``. The context must have the positions
    of the plant set to the initialIRIS seed configuration.

Parameter ``options``:
    provides additional configuration options. In particular,
    increasing ``options.num_collision_infeasible_samples`` increases
    the chances that the IRIS regions are collision free but can also
    significantly increase the run-time of the algorithm. The same
