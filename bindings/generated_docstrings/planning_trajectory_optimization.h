Warning:
    This feature is considered to be **experimental** and may change
    or be removed at any time, without any deprecation notice ahead of
    time.

Instead of using the full time-scaling curve, this problem uses a
single time-scaling variable for each region. This formulation yields
continuous trajectories, which are not differentiable at the
transition times between the regions since non-convex continuity
constraints are not supported yet. However, it supports continuity on
the path r(s) for arbitrary degree. The path r(s) can be reconstructed
from the gcs solution q(t) with ``NormalizeSegmentTimes()`` and
post-processed with e.g. Toppra to enforce acceleration bounds.

The ith piece of the composite trajectory is defined as q(t) = r((t -
tᵢ) / hᵢ). r : [0, 1] → ℝⁿ is a the path, parametrized as a Bézier
curve with order n. tᵢ and hᵢ are the initial time and duration of the
ith sub-trajectory.

This class supports the notion of a Subgraph of regions. This has
proven useful to facilitate multi-modal motion planning such as:
Subgraph A: find a collision-free trajectory for the robot to a
grasping posture, Subgraph B: find a collision-free trajectory for the
robot with the object in its hand to a placing posture, etc.

**** Continuous Revolute Joints

This class also supports robots with continuous revolute joints
(revolute joints that don't have any joint limits) and mobile bases.
Adding or subtracting 2π to such a joint's angle leaves it unchanged;
this logic is implemented behind the scenes. To use it, one should
specify the joint indices that don't have limits, and ensure all sets
satisfy the "convexity radius" property -- their width along a
dimension corresponding to a continuous revolute joint must be less
than π. This can be enforced when constructing the convex sets, or
after the fact with ``geometry::optimization::PartitionConvexSet``.
The ``GcsTrajectoryOptimization`` methods ``AddRegions`` and
``AddEdges`` will handle all of the intersection checks behind the
scenes, including applying the appropriate logic to connect sets that
"wrap around" 2π.)""";

    Subspace is optional. Only edges that connect through the subspace

    the first set is translated (in configuration space) by the

    copy of the regions since other functions may access them. If any
    of the positions represent revolute joints without limits, each
    region has a maximum width of strictly less than π along
    dimensions corresponding to those joints.

Parameter ``edges_between_regions``:
    is a list of pairs of indices into the regions vector. For each
    pair representing an edge between two regions, an edge is added
    within the subgraph. Note that the edges are directed so (i,j)
    will only add an edge from region i to region j.

Parameter ``order``:
    is the order of the Bézier curve.

Parameter ``h_max``:
    is the maximum duration to spend in a region (seconds). Some
    solvers struggle numerically with large values.

Parameter ``h_min``:
    is the minimum duration to spend in a region (seconds) if that
    region is visited on the optimal path. Some cost and constraints
    are only convex for h > 0. For example the perspective quadratic
    cost of the path energy ||ṙ(s)||² / h becomes non-convex for h =
    0. Otherwise h_min can be set to 0.

Parameter ``name``:
    is the name of the subgraph. If the passed name is an empty
    string, a default name will be provided.

Parameter ``edge_offsets``:
    is an optional list of vectors. If defined, the list must contain
    the same number of entries as ``edges_between_regions``. For each
    pair of sets listed in ``edges_between_regions``, the first set is
    translated (in configuration space) by the corresponding vector in
    edge_offsets before computing the constraints associated to that
    edge. This is used to add edges between sets that "wrap around" 2π
    along some dimension, due to, e.g., a continuous revolute joint.
    This edge offset corresponds to the translation component of the
    affine map τ_uv in equation (11) of "Non-Euclidean Motion Planning
    with Graphs of Geodesically-Convex Sets", and per the discussion
    in Subsection VI A, τ_uv has no rotation component. If
    edge_offsets is nullptr, it will instead be computed
    automatically.
