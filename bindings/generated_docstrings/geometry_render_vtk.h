Geometry perception properties
------------------------------

This RenderEngine implementation looks for the following properties
when registering visual geometry, categorized by rendered image type.

**RGB images**

| Group name | Property Name | Required | Property Type | Property
Description | | :--------: | :-----------: | :------: |
:-------------: | :------------------- | | phong | diffuse | no¹ |
Eigen::Vector4d | The rgba value of the object surface. | | phong |
diffuse_map | no² | std::string | The path to a texture to apply to
the geometry.³⁴ |

¹ If no diffuse value is given, a default rgba value will be applied.
The default color is a bright orange. This default value can be
changed to a different value at construction.

² If no path is specified, or the file cannot be read, the diffuse
rgba value is used (or its default).

³ RenderEngineVtk implements a legacy feature for associating textures
with *meshes*. If *no* ``(phong, diffuse_map)`` property is provided
(or it refers to a file that doesn't exist), for a mesh named
``/path/to/mesh.obj``, RenderEngineVtk will search for a file
``/path/to/mesh.png`` (replacing "obj" with "png"). If that image
exists, it will be used as a texture on the mesh object. ⁴ The render
engine consumes pngs with uchar channels. Pngs with a different bit
depth, e.g., uint16 channels, will be converted to that.

Note:
    RenderEngineVtk does not support the OBJ format ``usemtl``
    directive. Instead, it has two ways to associate a color texture
    with an obj file: - File name matching; see footnote 3 above. -
    Explicit assignment of arbitrary texture files from within model
    files. In SDFormat, use the tag tag_drake_diffuse_map. In URDF,
    use ``//visual/material/texture``.

**Depth images**

No specific properties required.

**Label images**

| Group name | Property Name | Required | Property Type | Property
Description | | :--------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
:-------------: | :------------------- | | label | id | no⁵ |
RenderLabel | The label to render into the image. |

⁵ When the label property is not set, RenderEngineVtk uses a default
render label of RenderLabel::kDontCare.

**Geometries accepted by RenderEngineVtk**

As documented in RenderEngine::RegisterVisual(), a RenderEngine
implementation can use the properties found in the
PerceptionProperties to determine whether it *accepts* a shape
provided for registration. RenderEngineVtk makes use of defaults to
accept *all* geometries (assuming the properties pass validation,
e.g., render label validation).

Several important notes when designing your lighting:

- Point lights do not cast shadows.
- Spot lights will not cast shadows if the spot light angle is 90 degrees
or more. At 90 degrees, the spot light is now a half-point light.
Even though 89.9 degrees *would* enable shadows, it is still an
impractical value. To actually see shadows, the ``shadow_map_size`` value
would have to be absurdly large to support such a wide extent.
- Directional lights will create a shadow map that spans the whole scene.
If your scene includes a geometry that is significantly larger than
the locale you're rendering, this will significantly reduce the
efficacy of the directional light's shadows. Consider truncating that
larger geometry. A common case would be to use a HalfSpace to define
a ground. A half space has infinite extent, so any reasonable
approximation would be quite large. Better to use a box targeted to
where you need it.

description of its PBR capabilities
<https://www.kitware.com/pbrj1/>`_). Drake uses the GenericFilmic tone
mapper and this value maps to its ``exposure`` property.

By default, exposure is undefined and *no* tone mapping is applied to
the image. Providing any value at all will enable tone mapping and can
be done so whether your scene uses default Phong illumination model or
physically-based rendering (e.g., such as when an environment map is
present or a glTF model has been added).

This property is analogous to the concept of "exposure" in traditional
photography. Exposure controls how much the film material is exposed
to the light in the scene. Too little exposure and the scene is dark
and muddy. Too much exposure, and the image becomes over saturated. As
the amount of radiant energy in the scene increases, reducing the
exposure may be necessary. In essence, exposure serves as a scale
factor on the radiant energy. When thinking about it as a scale
factor, it may *seem* that setting exposure to one would leave the
image unchanged (with respect to the images that RenderEngineVtk has
historically produced). This is not the case. As noted above, setting
any value, including one, enables tone mapping. Without tone mapping
enabled, there is a direct correlation between radiant energy on the
surface and the final pixel colors. Tone mapping defines a non-linear
relationship between illumination levels and pixel color.

The most common use for the ``exposure`` parameter is to combine an
environment map with shadow-casting lights. If the environment map
contains a great deal of light energy, it may overpower the strength
of your lights. By reducing the exposure (below one), the shadows
caused by the lights will become more distinct.

If you plan on working with shadows and environment maps, best
practice will be to set exposure to one and enable tone mapping. You
can increase the value if your image seems too dark, or reduce the
value if it seems "washed out".)""";

R"""(Screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO) parameters.

Ambient occlusion is a shading method used to calculate how exposed
each point in a scene is to ambient lighting. The more occluded a
point is, the darker it appears. SSAO is an efficient, real-time
approximation of ambient occlusion that operates in screen space. It
enhances the depth and realism of a scene by adding subtle shadowing
effects in creases, holes, and surfaces that are close to each other.
See https://www.kitware.com/ssao/ for an overview.

The default parameter values below have been chosen as a best-guess
effort at producing good quality images. They may not be optimal for
your particular scene.

To understand how to tune these parameters, you need a bit of insight
into how ambient occlusion works generally, and how SSAO works
specifically. For each pixel, its "occlusion factor" is determined by
examining a hemispherical area around the pixel's position in 3D space
(oriented based on its normal). The fraction of the hemisphere
contained within geometry is the occlusion factor.

SSAO produces a discrete approximation of the true occlusion factor.
It evaluates a discrete number of samples within the hemisphere and
compares their depths (in the OpenGL-camera sense) with that of the
pixel being shaded to determine how much of the hemisphere is occupied
by geometry. As with all discrete approximations, there is a tradeoff
between fidelity and cost. The parameter documentation below provides
some guidance on the effect of each parameter on the final rendered
image.)""";

how far in front (in meters) the recorded distance has to be before
the sample is considered occluded. Larger bias values will classify
fewer samples as occluded, reducing the amount of ambient occlusion
