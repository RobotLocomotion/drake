R"""(Defines the near and far clipping planes for frustum-based (OpenGL)
RenderEngine cameras.

**Guidance on selecting clipping plane values**

This documentation is targeted toward those who are unfamiliar with
the OpenGL rasterization pipeline. For in-depth explanations about how
the clipping range defines the viewing volume, see ` the discussion on
projective transforms
<https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter03.html#name3>`_. For more
detail on its effect on determining occlusion (which geometries are in
front), try ` "A Hidden-Surface Removal Survival Kit"
<https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter05.html#name1>`_.

*The short summary*

- The clipping range defines the distance of the *closest* and *farthest*
things that *can* appear in the rendering.
- Objects that cross the planes placed at those distances get clipped.
- Make the range as small as reasonably possible to get the best occlusion
(a.k.a. z-buffer) results.
- For depth cameras, make sure your clipping range always includes your valid
depth range.

*The longer discussion*

Given that the clipping range defines what you can/can't see in the
camera, it *might* be tempting to just put an arbitrarily large range
in (e.g., starting 1 micrometer away and going up to 1 million
kilometers away). By doing so, you know everything you put into your
scene will appear. If making sure things are visible were the only
factor, this would be fine.

Rasterization pipelines render objects in arbitrary order but have to
be able to determine which objects are in front of other objects as
they go. They achieve this by creating a "z-buffer". It is a measure
of the depth of the triangle that rendered to a particular "pixel".
When two triangles both want to color the same pixel, the triangle
with the smallest z-value is typically selected.

The z-buffer has fixed precision. That fixed precision is spread over
the entire available depth range (as defined by the clipping range).
The greater the range, the less precision the z-buffer has per meter
of depth. A small range may have the ability to distinguish objects
separated by 1 mm. But a large range may only be able to distinuish
objects separated by 1 m. Two objects with measurably different depths
relative to the camera, can become indistinguishable in the z-buffer
due to these precision issues; the object that ends up in front is due
to random chance. This will lead to artifacts where two objects near
the same depth will flicker back and forth in front of each other
(sometimes called "z fighting").

So, it is best to define the smallest clipping range that will include
the objects of the scene that you care about most.)""";

    It's important to carefully coordinate depth range and clipping

    clipping planes, but that would be a mistake. Objects closer than
    the depth range's minimum value have an occluding effect in
    reality. If the near clipping plane is set to the minimum depth
    range value, those objects will be clipped away and won't occlude
    as they should. In essence, the camera will see through them and
    return incorrect values from beyond the missing geometry. The near

    range. How much closer depends on the scenario. Given the

squared distance (with some linear attenuation due to atmospheric
effects). However, this often leads to undesirable illumination
effects in low-dynamic range rendering. Suitable values typically will
temper the quadratic effects with non-zero constant and linear terms.

If the values sum to 1, then, a surface one meter away from the light
will get full illumination (surfaces closer will get *magnified*
illumination. When tuning attenuation to achieve a particular falloff
*pattern*, it is common to *increase* the light ``intensity`` to
offset what would otherwise appear to be a rapid decay. By default,
the light is unattenuated, with constant illumination across all
distances.

When using directional lights, attenuation is best kept with the

- RGB (ImageRgba8U) : the RGB image has four channels in the following
order: red, green, blue, and alpha. Each channel is represented by
a uint8_t.

- Depth (ImageDepth32F) : the depth image has a depth channel represented
by a float. For a point in space ``P``, the value stored in the depth
channel holds *the Z-component of the position vector ``p_RP``.*
Note that this is different from the range data used by laser
range finders (like that provided by DepthSensor) in which the depth
value represents the distance from the sensor origin to the object's
surface.

- Label (ImageLabel16I) : the label image has single channel represented
by an int16_t. The value stored in the channel holds a RenderLabel value
which corresponds to an object class in the scene or an "empty" pixel (see
RenderLabel for more details).

**RenderLabels, registering geometry, and derived classes**

By convention, when registering a geometry, the provided properties
should contain no more than one RenderLabel instance, and that should
be the ``(label, id)`` property. RenderEngine provides the notion of a
*default render label* that will be applied where no ``(label, id)``
RenderLabel property is found. This default value can be one of two
values: RenderLabel::kDontCare or RenderLabel::kUnspecified. The
choice of default RenderLabel can be made at construction and it
affects registration behavior when the ``(label, id)`` property is
absent:

- RenderLabel::kUnspecified: throws an exception.
- RenderLabel::kDontCare: the geometry will be included in label images as
the generic, non-distinguishing label.

Choosing RenderLabel::kUnspecified is best in a system that wants
explicit feedback and strict enforcement on a policy of strict label
enforcement -- everything should receive a meaningful label. The
choice of RenderLabel::kDontCare is best for a less strict system in
which only some subset of geometry need be explicitly specified.

Derived classes configure their *de facto* default RenderLabel value,
or a user-configured default value, at construction, subject to the
requirements outlined above.

Derived classes should not access the ``(label, id)`` property
directly. RenderEngine provides a method to safely extract a
RenderLabel value from the PerceptionProperties, taking into account
the configured default value and the documented reserved_render_label
"RenderLabel semantics"; see GetRenderLabelOrThrow().)""";

In a "label image" (see RenderEngine::RenderLabelImage() for details)
each pixel value indicates the classification of the object that
rendered into that pixel. The RenderLabel class provides that value
and one label is associated with each rendered geometry.

The labels could be unique for each geometry, or multiple geometries
could all share the same label (becoming indistinguishable in the
label image). Ultimately, it is the user's responsibility to assign
labels in a manner that is meaningful for their application.

**Reserved labels**

There are several RenderLabels that are reserved. They have specific
meaning in the context of the rendering ecosystem and are globally
available to all applications. They are:

- ``empty``: a pixel with the ``empty`` RenderLabel value indicates that *no*
geometry rendered to that pixel. Implemented as RenderLabel::kEmpty.
- ``do not render``: any geometry assigned the ``do not render`` tag will *not* be
rendered into a label image. This is a clear declaration that a geometry
should be omitted. Useful for marking, e.g., glass windows so that the
visible geometry behind the glass is what is included in the label image.
Implemented as RenderLabel::kDoNotRender.
- ``don't care``: the ``don't care`` label is intended as a convenient dumping
ground. This would be for geometry that *should* render into the label image,
but whose class is irrelevant (e.g., the walls of a room a robot is working
in or the background terrain in driving simulation). Implemented as
RenderLabel::kDontCare.
- ``unspecified``: a default-constructed RenderLabel has an ``unspecified`` value.
Implemented as RenderLabel::kUnspecified.

Generally, there is no good reason to assign ``empty`` or
``unspecified`` labels to a geometry. A RenderEngine implementation is
entitled to throw an exception if you attempt to do so.

Usage
-----

An application can simply instantiate RenderLabel with an arbitrary
value. This allows the application to define a particular mapping from
render label class to a preferred RenderLabel value. For a label image
to be *meaningful*, every pixel value should admit an unambiguous
interpretation. The application bears *full* responsibility in making
sure that a single value is not inadvertently associated with multiple
render classes. Finally, a RenderLabel cannot be explicitly
constructed with a reserved value -- those can only be accessed
through the static methods provided.

Note:
    The RenderLabel class is based on a 16-bit integer. This makes the
    label image more compact but means there are only, approximately,
    32,000 unique RenderLabel values.)""";
