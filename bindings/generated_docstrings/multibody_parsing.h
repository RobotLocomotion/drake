--------------- URDF | ".urdf" SDFormat | ".sdf" MJCF (Mujoco XML) |
".xml" Drake Model Directives | ".dmd.yaml" Wavefront OBJ | ".obj"

The output of parsing is one or more model instances added to the
MultibodyPlant provided to the parser at construction.

For an introductory tutorial about parsing, see the <a

a Multibody Simulation</a> page.

SDFormat files may contain multiple ``<model>`` elements. New model
instances will be added to ``plant`` for each ``<model>`` tag in the
file.

Note:
    Adding multiple root-level models, i.e, ``<model>`s directly under
    `<sdf>``, is deprecated. If you need multiple models in a single
    file, please use an SDFormat world tag.

URDF files contain a single ``<robot>`` element. Only a single model
instance will be added to ``plant``.

MJCF (MuJoCo XML) files typically contain many bodies, they will all
be added as a single model instance in the ``plant``.

Drake Model Directives are only available via AddModels or
AddModelsFromString. The single-model methods (AddModelFromFile,
AddModelFromString) cannot load model directives.

OBJ files will infer a model with a single body from the geometry. The
OBJ file must contain a *single* object (in the OBJ-file sense). The
body's mass properties are computed based on uniform distribution of
material in the enclosed volume of the mesh (with the approximate
density of water: 1000 kg/m³). If the mesh is not a closed manifold,
this can produce unexpected results. The spatial inertia of the body
is measured at the body frame's origin. The body's frame is coincident
and fixed with the frame the mesh's vertices are measured and
expressed in. The mesh's vertices are assumed to be measured in units
of *meters*.

The name of the model and body are determined according to the
following prioritized protocol:

- The non-empty ``model_name``, if given (e.g., in
AddModelFromFile()). - If the object is named in the obj file, that
object name is used. - Otherwise, the base name of the file name is
used (i.e., the file name with the prefixed directory and extension
removed).

If the underlying plant is registered with a SceneGraph instance, the
mesh will also be used for all three roles: illustration, perception,
and proximity.

Warning:
    AddModelsFromString() cannot be passed OBJ file contents yet.

For more documentation of Drake-specific treatment of these input
formats, see multibody_parsing.

When parsing literal quantities, Parser assumes SI units and radians
in the absence of units specified by the format itself. This includes
the literals in the explicitly specified files as well as referenced
files such as OBJ or other data file formats.

MultibodyPlant requires that model instances have unique names. To
support loading multiple instances of the same model file(s) into a
plant, Parser offers a few different strategies.

Parser has constructors that take a model name prefix, which gets
applied to all models loaded with that Parser instance. The resulting
workflow makes multiple parsers to build models for a single plant:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    Parser left_parser(plant, "left");
     Parser right_parser(plant, "right");
     left_parser.AddModels(arm_model);  // "left::arm"
     right_parser.AddModels(arm_model);  // "right::arm"
     left_parser.AddModels(gripper_model);  // "left::gripper"
     right_parser.AddModels(gripper_model);  // "right::gripper"

.. raw:: html

    </details>

For situations where it is convenient to load a model many times,
Parser offers optional auto-renaming. When auto-renaming is enabled,
name collisions will be resolved by adding a subscript to the name.


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    Parser parser(plant);
     parser.SetAutoRenaming(true);
     // Subscripts are compact, and start at 1.
     parser.AddModels(rock);  // "rock"
     parser.AddModels(rock);  // "rock_1"
     parser.AddModels(rock);  // "rock_2"
     // Subscripts of different base names are independent.
     parser.AddModels(stone);  // "stone"
     parser.AddModels(stone);  // "stone_1"
     parser.AddModels(stone);  // "stone_2"

.. raw:: html

    </details>

(Advanced) In the rare case where the user is parsing into a
MultibodyPlant and SceneGraph but has created them one at a time
instead of using the more convenient AddMultibodyPlant() or
AddMultibodyPlantSceneGraph() functions, the Parser constructors
accept an optional SceneGraph pointer to specify which SceneGraph to
parse into. If it is provided and non-null and the MultibodyPlant is
not registered as a source, the Parser will perform the SceneGraph
registration into the given plant. We describe this option only for
completeness; we strongly discourage anyone from taking advantage of
this feature.)""";

The name must not be scoped (i.e., no "foo::link", just "link"). If
the name is empty, then the posed frame will be the body frame of the
model's sole body (and if the model has >1 body then it is an error).

For deformable bodies, the body pose defines the world pose of the
reference configuration, i.e. the undeformed geometry of the
deformable body will have this pose in the world frame.

However, the schema::Transform associated with that named body/frame
can define a ``base_frame`` referring to any frame that has been added
prior to or including this declaration. The named frame must *always*
be a scoped name, even if its part of the model added by this
directive.

Warning:
    there are two important implications for the named frame if the
    transform's ``base_frame`` is not the world (explicitly or
    implicitly by omission):

1. The named body will *not* be considered a "floating base" body (see
mbp_working_with_free_bodies "Working with free bodies"). Calls to
MultibodyPlant::SetDefaultFreeBodyPose() will have no effect on an
allocated context. If you want to change its default pose after adding
the model, you need to acquire the body's joint and set the new
default pose on the joint directly. Note: what you will *actually* be
posing is the *named* frame. If it's the name of the body, you will be
posing the body. If it's a frame affixed to the body frame, you will
be posing the fixed frame (with the body offset based on the
relationship between the two frames). 2. The body associated with the
named frame will have a six-dof joint between itself and the body
associated with the transform's ``base_frame``. When interpreting the
qs for the "named" body, it is the six-dof pose of the body measured
and expressed in the parent frame (transform's ``base_frame``). This
is true whether setting the position values in the resulting joint
directly or using the mbp_working_with_free_bodies "MultibodyPlant
free body APIs". 3. If the body is deformable, non-world
``base_frame`` is an error.

    bodies implied by the named frames.)""";
