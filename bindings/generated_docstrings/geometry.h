scope of various proximity queries.

The sole source of CollisionFilterManager instances is SceneGraph. See
scene_graph_collision_filter_manager "SceneGraph's documentation" for
details on acquiring an instance.

A SceneGraph instance contains the set of geometry ``G = D ⋃ A = {g₀,
g₁, ..., gₙ}``, where D is the set of dynamic geometries and A is the
set of anchored geometries (by definition ``D ⋂ A = ∅``). `Gₚ ⊂ G` is
the subset of geometries that have a proximity role (with an analogous
interpretation of ``Dₚ`` and ``Aₚ``). Many proximity queries operate
on pairs of geometries (e.g., (gᵢ, gⱼ)). The set of proximity
candidate pairs for such queries is initially defined as ``C = (Gₚ ×
Gₚ) - (Aₚ × Aₚ) - Fₚ - Iₚ``, where:

- ``Gₚ × Gₚ = {(gᵢ, gⱼ)}, ∀ gᵢ, gⱼ ∈ Gₚ`` is the Cartesian product of the set
of SceneGraph proximity geometries.
- ``Aₚ × Aₚ`` represents all pairs consisting only of anchored geometries;
an anchored geometry is never tested against another anchored geometry.
- ``Fₚ = {(gᵢ, gⱼ)} ∀ i, j``, such that ``gᵢ, gⱼ ∈ Dₚ`` and
``frame(gᵢ) == frame(gⱼ)``; the pairs where both geometries are rigidly
affixed to the same frame.
- ``Iₚ = {(g, g)}, ∀ g ∈ Gₚ`` is the set of all pairs consisting of a
geometry with itself; there is no meaningful proximity query on a
geometry with itself.

Only pairs contained in C will be included in pairwise proximity
operations.

The manager provides an interface to modify the set C. Changes to C
are articulated with CollisionFilterDeclaration. Once a change has
been *declared* it is applied via the manager's API to change the
configuration of C.

There are limits to how C can be modified.

- ``∀ (gᵢ, gⱼ) ∈ C``, both gᵢ and gⱼ must be registered with SceneGraph; you
can't inject arbitrary ids. Attempting to do so will result in an error.
- No pairs in ``Aₚ × Aₚ``, `Fₚ`, or ``Iₚ`` can ever be added to C. Excluding
those pairs is a SceneGraph invariant. Attempts to do so will be ignored.

The current configuration of C depends on the sequence of filter
declarations that have been applied in the manager. Changing the order
can change the end result.

A CollisionFilterManager is a view into geometry data (either that
owned by a SceneGraph instance or a SceneGraph context). The manager
instance can be copied or moved and the resulting instance is a view
into the same data. For both the original and the copy (or just the
target when moving the manager), the source data must stay alive for
at least as long as the manager instance.

Warning:
    The effect of applying a declaration is based on the state of
    SceneGraph's geometry data at the time of application. More
    concretely: - For a particular FrameId in a GeometrySet instance,
    only those geometries attached to the identified frame with the
    proximity role assigned at the time of the call will be included
    in the filter. If geometries are subsequently added or assigned
    the proximity role, they will not be retroactively added to the
    user-declared filter. - If the geometry set in a declaration
    statement includes geometries which have *not* been assigned a
    proximity role, those geometries will be ignored. If a proximity
    role is subsequently assigned, those geometries will *still* not
    be part of any user-declared collision filters. - In general,
    adding collisions and assigning proximity roles should happen
    prior to collision filter configuration.

**Transient vs Persistent changes**

Collision filtering is all about defining which geometry pairs are in
the set C. The simplest way to modify the set C is through
*persistent* modifications to a "base configuration" (via calls to
Apply()). However, declarations can also be applied in a *transient*
manner. Transient declarations form a history. The current definition
of the set C is the result of applying the history of collision filter
declarations to the persistent base configuration in order. That
history can be modified:

- New transient declarations can be appended.
- Arbitrary transient declarations can be removed from the sequence.
- The current configuration (based on a history with an arbitrary number
of transient declarations) can be "flattened" into the persistent base
(with no history).

The table below illustrates a sequence of operations and their effect
on C. We define C's initial configuration as ``C = {P₁, P₂, ..., Pₙ}``
(for ``n`` geometry pairs). Each action is described as either
persistent or transient.

| Line | C | Action | | :--: | :------------------ |
:-------------------------------------------------- | | 1 | ``{P₁, P₂,
..., Pₙ}`` | Initial condition of the persistent base | | 2 | ``{P₂,
..., Pₙ}`` | Remove P₁ from the persistent base | | 3 | ``{P₂, ...,
Pₙ₋₁}`` | Remove Pₙ from the persistent base | | 4 | ``{P₂}`` | Remove
all pairs except P₂ from the persistent base | | 5 | ``{P₂, P₄, P₅}``
| Transient declaration #1 puts P₄ and P₅ into C | | 6 | ``{P₂, P₃,
P₄, P₅}`` | Transient declaration #2 puts P₃ and P₄ into C | | 7 |
``{P₂, P₃, P₄}`` | Remove declaration #1. | | 8 | ``{P₂, P₃, P₄}`` |
Configuration flattened; #2 no longer exists | **Table 1**: An example
sequence of operations on collision filters.

Notes: - lines 2 - 4 represent a series of *persistent* operations,
filtering pairs of geometry (aka removing them from C by calling
Apply()). - line 5: the first transient filter declaration which is
assigned the id value #1 (via a call to ApplyTransient()). - line 6:
Adds a new transient filter declaration to the sequence (assigned id
#2). Note, that it redundantly declares that P₄ is a member of C just
as declaration #1 did. This redundancy is fine. In fact, it may be
very important (see below). - line 7: We remove declaration #1.
Although #1 added both P₄ and P₅ to C, the result of removing this
declaration from the sequence is that P₅ is no longer a member of C
but P₄ *is*. This is because #2's declaration that P₄ is* in C
preserves its membership. - line 8: the current configuration is
"flattened" into the persistent base. All history is thrown out and
any filter identifiers are rendered invalid.

This example workflow above illustrates some key ideas in using
transient declarations.

- **The persistent configuration can only be modified when there is no
transient history.** Applying a filter declaration should have the effect
of realizing that declaration. If a pair is *declared* to be in C, the
result of the declaration is that the pair is in C (assuming that the pair
can* be in C). If we allowed modifying the persistent configuration with
an active transient history, there might be no discernible change in the
resultant configuration state because a subsequent transient declaration
may supplant it. This would lead to inscrutable bugs. Therefore, it's
simply not allowed.
- **When defining a transient declaration, the declaration should include all
critical pairs *explicitly*.** This includes those pairs that should and
should not be in C. Any pair *not* explicitly accounted for should be one
whose filter status is immaterial.
It *might* seems desirable (from an optimization perspective) to examine
the *current* configuration of C and apply the minimum change to put it
into a desired state (i.e., if a pair I need filtered is already filtered,
I would omit it from the declaration). This approach is fraught with peril.
If the current configuration is the result of previous transient
declarations, the removal of any of those declarations could invalidate the
attempted difference calculation and my declaration would no longer be
sufficient to guarantee the set C required.
- **Anyone at any time can add to the history.** Some code can modify C to
suit its needs. However, it can also make subsequent calls into code that
also modifies C with no guarantees that the called code will undo those
changes. Code that modifies collision filters configuration should document
that it does so. It should also have a clear protocol for cleaning up its
own changes. Finally, code that applies declarations should not take for
granted that its transient declarations are necessarily the last
declarations in the history.

*Making transient filter declarations*

There is a custom API for applying a filter declaration as a
*transient* declaration. It returns the id for the transient API (used
to remove the declaration from the history sequence).

active transient declarations in the history will throw an exception.)""";

distance smaller than δ₁+δ₂.

Refer to hydro_margin for further details, including theory, examples,
recommended margin values and limitations.

There will only be *contact* if the two zero level sets intersect.
Unless the zero level sets of both geometries overlap, there is no
contact and no contact force. However, (speculative) contact
constraints will be added allowing our discrete contact solvers to
predict if a contact "will" occur at the next time step. This leads to
additional time coherence and stability. Analytical studies of
stability show that a value of 0.1 mm to 1.0 mm is more than enough
for most robotics applications. This is not an "action-at-a-distance"
trick, there is no contact when the thin margin layers of two objects
overlap. The margin is simply a "cheap" mechanism to avoid
significantly more complex and costly strategies such as Continuous
Collision Detection.

Note:
    Inflating the geometries does not appreciably change the domain of
    contact. In the original mesh, the contact pressure is zero on the

.. pydrake_system::

    name: DrakeVisualizer
    input_ports:
    - query_object

The DrakeVisualizer system broadcasts three kinds of LCM messages:

- a message that defines the non-deformable geometries in the world on the
lcm channel named "DRAKE_VIEWER_LOAD_ROBOT"
- a message that updates the poses of those non-deformable geometries on the
lcm channel named "DRAKE_VIEWER_DRAW",
- a message that sets the world space vertex positions of the deformable
geometries on the lcm channel named "DRAKE_VIEWER_DEFORMABLE"

If requested in DrakeVisualizerParams, the above channel names are
modified according to the role specified. This allows simultaneous
availability of geometry from multiple roles, by using multiple
DrakeVisualizer instances.

- kIllustration: channel names gain a "_ILLUSTRATION" suffix.
- kProximity: channel names gain a "_PROXIMITY" suffix.
- kPerception: channel names gain a "_PERCEPTION" suffix.

The system uses the versioning mechanism provided by SceneGraph to
detect changes to the geometry so that a change in SceneGraph's data
will propagate to the message receiver.

**Visualization by Role**

By default, DrakeVisualizer visualizes geometries with the
illustration role (see geometry_roles for more details). It can be
configured to visualize geometries with other roles (see
DrakeVisualizerParams). Only one role can be specified.

The appearance of the geometry in the visualizer is typically defined
by the geometry's properties for the visualized role.

- For the visualized role, if a geometry has the ("phong", "diffuse")
property described in the table below, that value is used.
- Otherwise, if the geometry *also* has the illustration properties, those
properties are likewise tested for the ("phong", "diffuse") property. This
rule only has significance is the visualized role is *not* the illustration
role.
- Otherwise, the configured default color will be applied (see
DrakeVisualizerParams).

| Group name | Required | Property Name | Property Type | Property
Description | | :--------: | :------: | :-----------: |
:-------------: | :------------------- | | phong | no | diffuse | Rgba
| The rgba value of the object surface. |

*Appearance of OBJ files for non-deformable geometries*

Meshes represented by OBJ are special. The OBJ file can reference a
material file (.mtl). If the mtl file is found by the receiving
application, values in the .mtl will take precedence over the
("phong", "diffuse") geometry property.

It's worth emphasizing that these rules permits control over the
appearance of collision geometry on a per-geometry basis by assigning
an explicit Rgba value to the ("phong", "diffuse") property in the
geometry's ProximityProperties.

Note:
    If collision geometries are added to SceneGraph by parsing
    URDF/SDF files, they will not have diffuse values. Even if
    elements were added to the specification files, they would not be
    parsed. They must be added to the geometries after parsing.

**Effective visualization**

The best visualization is when draw messages have been preceded by a
compatible load message (i.e., a "coherent" message sequence). While
LCM doesn't guarantee that messages will be received/processed in the
same order as they are broadcast, your results will be best if
DrakeVisualizer is allowed to broadcast coherent messages. Practices
that interfere with that will likely produce undesirable results.
E.g.,

- Evaluating a single instance of DrakeVisualizer across several threads,
such that the data in the per-thread systems::Context varies.
- Evaluating multiple instances of DrakeVisualizer in a single thread that
share the same lcm::DrakeLcmInterface.

**Mesh support**

DrakeVisualizer is mesh file format agnostic. A Mesh or Convex shape
that references arbitrary mesh files will simply be packaged in the
broadcast LCM message. It defers to the message *receiver* on whether
that particular file format is supported.

**Scalar support and conversion**

DrakeVisualizer is templated on ``T`` and can be used in a ``double``-
or AutoDiffXd-valued Diagram. However, the diagram can only be
converted from one scalar type to another if the DrakeVisualizer
*owns* its lcm::DrakeLcmInterface instance. Attempts to scalar convert
the system otherwise will throw an exception.)""";

some sort), a pose (relative to a parent "frame" P), material
information, and an opaque collection of metadata. The parent frame
can be a registered frame or another registered geometry.

Every GeometryInstance must be named. The naming convention mirrors
that of valid names in SDF files. Specifically, any user-specified
name will have all leading and trailing space and tab characters
trimmed off. The trimmed name will have to satisfy the following
requirements:

- cannot be empty, and
- the name should be unique in the scope of its frame and role. For example,
two GeometryInstances can both be called "ball" as long as they are
affixed to different frames or if one is a collision geometry and the
other is an illustration geometry. This is enforced when a role is assigned
to the geometry.

If valid, the trimmed name will be assigned to the instance.

Names *can* have internal whitespace (e.g., "my geometry name").

**Canonicalized names**

The silent transformation of a user-defined name to canonical name
mirrors that of specifying geometry names in an SDF file. Consider the
following SDF snippet:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    {xml}
    ...
    <visual name="  visual">
    <geometry>

    <radius>1.0</radius>
    </sphere>
    </geometry>
    </visual>
    ...

.. raw:: html

    </details>

The name has two leading whitespace characters. The parsing process
will consider this name as equivalent to "visual" and tests for
uniqueness and non-emptiness will be applied to that trimmed result.
The following code has an analogous effect:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    scene_graph->RegisterGeometry(
    source_id, frame_id,
    make_unique<GeometryInstance>(pose, make_unique<Sphere>(1.0), "  visual"));

.. raw:: html

    </details>

trimmed and the *result* will be stored in the GeometryInstance (to be

R"""(The base class for defining a set of geometry properties.

Each property consists of a ``(group, property)`` name-pair and a
typed value. The name pair allows for reuse of common property names
(e.g., "diffuse") to be differentiated in interpretation by
associating them with different groups. The only restriction on the
value type is that it must be either cloneable or copy-constructible.

A set of geometry property values are defined when geometry is
registered with SceneGraph by an instantiator and accessed by some
downstream consumer entity. Each consumer specifies what properties it
expects to find and what default values (if any) it provides. For
example, the consumer could document that a particular property is
always required and its absence would throw an exception.
Alternatively, it could indicate that a property is optional and a
default value will be used in its absence. It is the responsibility of
the instantiator to make sure that the geometry property values are
*correctly* defined according to the expected consumer's
specification. Correctness includes such issues as key-value pairs
placed into a *correctly*-spelled group, property keys being likewise
correctly spelled, and values of the expected type. Correct spelling
includes correct case. The instantiator uses the AddProperty() method
to add new properties to the set.

To read the property (``some_group``, `some_property`) from a property
set:

1. Optionally test to see if the property exists by confirming the group
``some_group`` is in the set via HasGroup() and that the property
``some_property`` is in ``some_group`` via HasProperty(). Attempting to access
a property with a non-existent (group, property) pair may lead to an
exception (see API documentation below).
2. Acquire a property value via the GetProperty() or GetPropertyOrDefault()
methods.
NOTE: Reading a property requires a compile-time declaration of the *type*
of value being read. If the stored value is of a different type, an
exception will be thrown.

Common workflows
----------------

The following examples outline a number of ways to create and consume
geometry properties. By design, GeometryProperties cannot be
constructed, copied, or moved directly. Only derived classes can do
so. This facilitates *strongly typed* sets of properties associated
with particular geometry roles. So, for these examples we'll exercise
the derived class associated with proximity queries:
ProximityProperties.

The string-based structure of GeometryProperties provides a great deal
of flexibility at the cost of spelling sensitivity. It would be easy
to introduce typos that would then "hide" property values in some
group a consumer wouldn't look. In these examples, we avoid using
string literals as group or property names (at least in the cases
where the same name is used multiple times) to help avoid the
possibility of typo-induced errors. That is not required and certainly
not the only way to avoid such bugs.

**Creating properties**

*Creating properties in a new group*

This is a simple example in which a single group is added with
properties of various types.


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    const std::string group_name("my_group");
    ProximityProperties properties;
    // This first invocation implicitly creates the group "my_group".
    properties.AddProperty(group_name, "count", 7);     // int type
    properties.AddProperty(group_name, "length", 7.);   // double type
    properties.AddProperty(group_name, "name", "7");    // std::string type

.. raw:: html

    </details>

*Creating properties in the default group*

Similar to the previous examples, the properties are added to the
default group. Just be aware that if multiple sites in your code add
properties to the default group, the possibility that names get
repeated increases. Property names *must* be unique within a single
group, including the default group.


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    ProximityProperties properties;
    properties.AddProperty(ProximityProperties::default_group_name(), "count", 7);
    properties.AddProperty(ProximityProperties::default_group_name(), "width", 7.);
    properties.AddProperty(ProximityProperties::default_group_name(), "name", "7");

.. raw:: html

    </details>

*Aggregate properties in a struct*

In some cases, there is a set of values that will *always* be accessed
together (specified with coordinated semantics). In these cases, it
makes sense to aggregate them into a struct and store that as a single
value. This reduces the number of lookups required.

It's worth noting, that if the data value is a struct, calls to
GetPropertyOrDefault() still operate as an "all-or-nothing" basis. If
the property *struct* exists, it will be returned, if it's missing the

struct in which some undefined values in the struct will be replaced
with their corresponding values in the default struct.

**Reading properties**

This section describes how to read properties under several different
scenarios: (a) when specific properties are required, (b) when the
consumer provides a default value for missing properties, and (c) when
the consumer needs to inspect what properties are available.

*Look up specific, *required* properties*

In this case, the consumer of the properties is looking for one or
more specific properties. It will ignore any other properties. More
particularly, if those properties are missing, it is considered a
runtime error and an exception is thrown.

The error can be handled in one of two ways: simply let the generic
exception generated by GeometryProperties propagate upward, or detect
the missing property and throw an exception with a custom message. The
example below shows both approaches.


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    const IllustrationProperties& properties = FunctionThatReturnsProperties();
    // Looking for a Rgba of rgba colors named "rgba" - send generic error that
    // the property set is missing the required property.
    const Rgba rgba =
    properties.GetProperty<Rgba>("MyGroup", "rgba");
    
    // Explicitly detect missing property and throw exception with custom message.
    if (!properties.HasProperty("MyGroup", "rgba")) {
    throw RuntimeError(
    "ThisClass: Missing the necessary 'rgba' property; the object cannot be "
    "rendered");
    }
    // Otherwise acquire value, confident that no exception will be thrown.
    const Rgba rgba =
    properties.GetProperty<Rgba>("MyGroup", "rgba");

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Note:
    calls to ``GetProperty()`` always require the return type template
    value (e.g., ``Rgba``) to be specified in the call.

*Look up specific properties with default property values*

As with the previous case, the consumer is looking for one or more
specific properties. However, in this case, the consumer provides a
default value to use in case the target property is not defined. In
this invocation, the template parameter need not be explicitly
declared -- the inferred return type will be the same as the default
value.

.. code-block:: c++

    const IllustrationProperties& properties = FunctionThatReturnsProperties();
    // Looking for a Rgba of rgba colors named "rgba".
    const Rgba default_color{0.9, 0.9, 0.9};
    const Rgba rgba =
    properties.GetPropertyOrDefault("MyGroup", "rgba", default_color);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Alternatively, the default value can be provided in one of the
following forms:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    properties.GetPropertyOrDefault("MyGroup", "rgba",
    Rgba{0.9, 0.9, 0.9});
    properties.GetPropertyOrDefault<Rgba>("MyGroup", "rgba",
    {0.9, 0.9, 0.9});

.. raw:: html

    </details>

*Iterating through provided properties*

Another alternative is to iterate through the properties that *have*
been provided. This might be done for several reasons, e.g.:

- the consumer wants to validate the set of properties, giving the user
feedback if an unsupported property has been provided, and/or
- the consumer has a default value for every property and allows the
registering code to define only those properties that deviate from the
specified default.

Working with properties in this manner requires knowledge of how to
work with AbstractValue.

    // Throws an exception if the named parameter is of the wrong type.

    }
    }

If a System only ever emits a single frame/geometry (or
small-constant-number of frames/geometries), then there's a shorter
alternative way to write a Calc method, using an initializer_list:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    void CalcFramePoseOutput(const Context<T>& context,
    geometry::FramePoseVector<T>* poses) const {
    const RigidTransform<T>& pose = ...;
    poses = {{frame_id_, pose}};
    }

.. raw:: html

    </details>

N.B. When the systems framework calls the ``Calc`` method, the value
pointed to by ``poses`` is in an unspecified state. The implementation
of ``Calc`` must always ensure that ``poses`` contains the correct
value upon return, no matter what value it started with. The easy ways
to do this are to call either ``poses->clear()`` or the assignment
operator ``*poses = ...``.

Template parameter ``Id``:
    The key used to locate the kinematics data. Can be FrameId or
    GeometryId.

Template parameter ``KinematicsValue``:
    The underlying data type of the kinematics data (e.g., pose,
    configuration, or velocity).

The FramePoseVector and GeometryConfigurationVector classes are
aliases of the KinematicsVector instantiated on specific data types
(RigidTransform and VectorX respectively). Each of these data types
are templated on Eigen scalars. All supported combinations of data
type and scalar type are already available to link against in the
containing library. No other values for KinematicsValue are supported.

Currently, the following data types with the following scalar types
are supported:

The mesh may be a triangular surface mesh or a tetrahedral volume
mesh, depending on how it used.

Meshes can be used with all three roles but, currently, the support
for the proximity role is limited. Where a general mesh is not
supported, the mesh is replaced by its convex hull. See the
documentation of QueryObject's proximity queries for more details. The
notable cases where the actual mesh topology is used includes:

- Computing signed distances from the Mesh to query points (when it
references a .obj file or a tetrahedral .vtk file).
- Specifying the Mesh as rigid hydroelastic (when it references a triangle
.obj file or a tetrahedral .vtk file).
- Specifying the Mesh as compliant hydroelastic (when it references a
tetrahedral .vtk file).
- Specifying the Mesh as deformable (when it references a tetrahedral .vtk
file).

This convex-hull substitution is a regrettable stop-gap solution until
we fully support general, non-convex meshes throughout proximity
queries.

For visual roles (illustration and perception), the specified mesh
file is used as directly as possible.

The mesh is defined in a canonical frame C, implicit in the file
parsed. Upon loading it in SceneGraph it can be scaled around the
origin of C by a given ``scale`` amount.

Note: a negative scale can be applied. This can be useful in mirroring
the geometry (e.g., using a right hand mesh for a left hand).
Mirroring the geometry will typically change the "winding" of the mesh
elements. By convention, Drake looks at the *ordering* of the vertices
that form mesh elements (triangles and tetrahedra) and derives the
notion of "inside" and "outside" relative to that element. In order to
preserve the input mesh's definition of "inside" and "outside", when
the mesh gets mirrored Drake may perturb the ordering of the vertex
indices. For example, a triangle originally referencing vertices ``[0
1 2]``, when mirrored may change to ``[2 1 0]``, so don't be surprised
if you introspect the details of the loaded mesh and you see such a
change. An analogous change can affect the vertex ordering of
tetrahedra in a volume mesh (i.e., a perturbation of the original
vertex index list ``[0 1 2 3]`` to ``[2 1 0 3]``).)""";

================================

https://github.com/meshcat-dev/meshcat#api provides a nice
introduction to the websocket API that we wrap with this class. One of
the core concepts is the "scene tree" -- a directory-like structure of
objects, transforms, and properties. The scene tree is viewable in the
browser by clicking on "Open Controls" in the top right corner.

Elements of the tree are referenced programmatically by a
"/"-delimited string indicating the object's **path** in the scene
tree. An object at path "/foo/bar" is a child of an object at path
"/foo", so setting the transform of (or deleting) "/foo" will also
affect its children.

The string path arguments to the methods in this class use the
following semantics: - A path that begins with "/" is treated as an
absolute path, and is used without modification. - A path that *does
not* begin with "/" is treated as a relative path to the default
working directory. - The "working directory" is fixed to be "/drake"
in the current implementation. So any relative path "foo" will be
treated as "/drake/foo". - Delete("/foo") will remove all objects,
transforms, and properties in "/foo" and its children from the scene
tree. - Delete() is equivalent to Delete("") or Delete("/drake/"). -
SetObject("/foo", ...) places the object at "/foo/<object>", where
"<object>" is a hard-coded suffix used for all objects. You can use
the Delete("/foo/<object>") to delete the object only (and not the
children of "/foo") and must use SetProperty("/foo/<object>", ...) to
change object-specific properties.

The root directory contains a number of elements that are set up
automatically in the browser. These include "/Background", "/Lights",
"/Grid", and "/Cameras". To find more details please see the @link
https://github.com/meshcat-dev/meshcat#api meshcat documentation
@endlink and the @link https://threejs.org/docs/index.html three.js
documentation @endlink. - You can modify these elements, create new
lights/cameras, and even delete these elements (one at a time). -
Delete("/") is not allowed. It will be silently ignored.

Recommended workflow
====================

For convenience, Meshcat fosters a work flow in which all user-created
objects created in Drake are contained in the "/drake" folder. Objects
added with a relative path are placed in the "/drake" folder for you.
The benefits are: - It's simple to distinguish between user objects
and "infrastructure" objects in the visualizer. - All user objects can
easily be cleared by a single, parameter-free call to Delete(). You
are welcome to use absolute paths to organize your data, but the
burden on tracking and cleaning them up lie on you.

Parameters for the hosted Meshcat page
======================================

Meshcat has an *experimental* AR/VR option (using WebXR). It can be
enabled through url parameters. For example, for a meshcat url
``http://localhost:7000``, the following will enable the VR mode:

http://localhost:7000?webxr=vr

To to use augmented reality (where the meshcat background is replaced
with your device's camera image), use:

http://localhost:7000?webxr=ar

If augmented reality is not available, it will fallback to VR mode.

Some notes on using the AR/VR modes:

- Before starting the WebXR session, position the interactive camera to be
approximately where you want the origin of the head set's origin to be.
- The meshcat scene controls are disabled while the WebXR session is active.
- WebXR sessions can only be run with *perspective* cameras.
- The controllers can be *visualized* but currently can't interact with the
Drake simulation physically. To visualize the controllers append the
additional url parameter ``controller=on`` as in
``http://localhost:7000?webxr=vr&controller=on``.

If you do not have AR/VR hardware, you can use an emulator in your
browser to experiment with the mode. Use an browser plugin like WebXR
API Emulator (i.e., for
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webxr-api-emulator/mjddjgeghkdijejnciaefnkjmkafnnje)
or
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webxr-api-emulator/)).

The AR/VR mode is not currently supported in offline mode (i.e., when
saving as StaticHtml()).

then no messages are sent and the returned gamepad index will not have

gamepads are detected in the same Meshcat window, then only the status

is running on a remote machine (e.g. in the cloud), and the Meshcat

time *may* trigger a realtime rate message to the meshcat visualizer
client based on the configured value in
MeshcatParams::realtime_rate_period value.

Invoking this method *may* dispatch a message to clients. The
following rules apply to invocations and messages:

- The first invocation is necessary to *initialize* the calculation; it
defines the the starting point from which all calculations are performed
(for both wall clock time as well as simulation time). As no interval can
be measured from a single invocation, no rate can be computed. Therefore,
the first invocation will *never* broadcast the message.
- Wall clock time must advance at least MeshcatParams::realtime_rate_period
seconds for a message to be sent.
- Meshcat promises to broadcast one message per elapsed period -- starting
from initialization -- regardless of the frequency at which
SetSimulationTime() actually gets invoked. If the elapsed time between
invocations exceeds MeshcatParams::realtime_rate_period, multiple
messages will be broadcast; one for each complete period.
- This implies that each column of pixels in the realtime rate chart in
the client visualizer represents a fixed amount of wall clock time.

When the realtime rate is broadcast, that value will be reported by
GetRealtimeRate().

The realtime rate calculation can be "reset" by passing a simulation
time value that is *strictly less* than the value of the previous
invocation. This has the effect of re-initializing the calculation
with the passed time and the wall clock time of the invocation. So, if
the simulation's context gets reset to ``time = 0``, calls to this
method passing the context time will implicitly reset realtime rate
calculations accordingly. Resetting the calculator will reset the
value reported by GetRealtimeRate() to zero.

This function is safe to be called redundantly with the same
simulation time. Redundant calls are a no-op.

R"""(The QueryObject serves as a mechanism to perform geometry queries on
the world's geometry. The SceneGraph has an abstract-valued port that
contains a QueryObject (i.e., a QueryObject-valued output port).

To perform geometry queries on SceneGraph: - a LeafSystem must have a
QueryObject-valued input port and connect it to the corresponding
query output port on SceneGraph, - the querying LeafSystem can
evaluate the input port, retrieving a ``const QueryObject&`` in
return, and, finally, - invoke the appropriate method on the
QueryObject.

The const reference returned by the input port is considered "live" -
it is linked to the context, system, and cache (making full use of all
of those mechanisms). This const reference should *never* be
persisted; doing so can lead to erroneous query results. It is simpler
and more advisable to acquire it for evaluation in a limited scope
(e.g., CalcTimeDerivatives()) and then discard it. If a QueryObject is
needed for many separate functions in a LeafSystem, each should
re-evaluate the input port. The underlying caching mechanism should
make the cost of this negligible.

The QueryObject *can* be copied. The copied instance is no longer
"live"; it is now "baked". Essentially, it freezes the state of the
live scene graph in its current configuration and disconnects it from
the system and context. This means, even if the original context
changes values, the copied/baked instance will always reproduce the
same query results. This baking process is not cheap and should not be
done without consideration.

Queries and scalar type
-----------------------

A QueryObject *cannot* be converted to a different scalar type. A
QueryObject of scalar type T can only be acquired from the output port
of a SceneGraph of type T evaluated on a corresponding Context, also
of type T.

QueryObject's support for arbitrary scalar type is incomplete. Not all
queries support all scalar types to the same degree. Furthermore, the
queries are typically served by *families* of algorithms. The
evaluation of a query between a particular pair of geometries will
depend on the query, the pair of geometry types involved, and the
scalar type. From query to query, the treatment of a geometry (or
geometry pair) for a given scalar type can vary in many ways,
including but not limited to: ignoring the geometry, throwing an
exception, results with limited precision, or full, accurate support.
The queries below provide tables to help inform your expectations when
evaluating queries. The tables all use a common methodology and admit
a common interpretation.

For each (query, geometry-pair, scalar) combination, we create a set
of geometric configurations with known answers. We evaluate the
precision of the query result (if supported at all) over the entire
set and report the *worst* observed error. This is a purely empirical
approach and doesn't fully characterize the families of underlying
algorithms, and the reported error may be misleading in that we've
missed far worse latent error or that the error reported doesn't well
represent the average case.

The families of algorithms also differ in how their inherent errors
scale with the scale of the problem (e.g., size of geometries,
magnitude of distance/depth, etc.) Attempting to fully characterize
that aspect is both arduous and problematic, so, we've chosen a more
*representative* approach.

Because Drake is primarily intended for robot simulation, we've
created geometric configurations on the scale of common robot
manipulators (on the order of 20cm). We position them with a known
penetration depth (or separating distance) of 2 mm. The error reported
is the deviation from that expected result.

When interpreting the tables, keep the following in mind: - The table
illustrates trends in *broad* strokes, only. It does not represent an
exhaustive analysis. - If your problem involves larger geometries,
greater penetration depths, or larger separating distances, the error
will vary. Do not assume that observed error in this context is
necessarily relative -- there truly is that much variability in the
families of algorithms. - These values are an attempt to capture the
*worst* case outcome. The error shown is a single-significant-digit
approximation of that observed error. - These values may not actually
represent the true worst case; discovering the true worst case is
generally challenging. These represent our best effort to date. If you
find outcomes that are worse those reported here, please ` submit a
bug <https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake/issues/new>`_. - These
tables represent Drake's transient state. The eventual goal is to
report no more than 1e-14 error across all supportable geometry pairs
and scalars. At that point, the table will simply disappear.)""";

In the current incarnation, this function represents an incomplete
implementation. That has several implications, as described below:

- This table shows which shapes can be declared for use in hydroelastic
contact, and what compliance can be assigned.

| Shape | Compliant | Rigid | | :-------: | :-------: | :---: | |
Sphere | yes | yes | | Cylinder | yes | yes | | Box | yes | yes | |
Capsule | yes | yes | | Ellipsoid | yes | yes | | HalfSpace | yes |
yes | | Mesh | yesᵃ | yesᵇ | | Convex | yesᶜ | yesᶜ |

- ᵃ The exact representation of a compliant mesh depends on the type of
mesh file it references:
- .obj: the convex hull of the mesh will be used (as if it were
declared to be a Convex shape).
- .vtk: the tetrahedral mesh will be used directly. This external
working
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZtVsxIjOLKvgQ8SNSrF6PtWuPW5z9PP7-dQuxfmqpc/edit?usp=sharing">
document</a> provides guidance how to generate a tetrahedral mesh
in a VTK file from a surface mesh in an OBJ file.
- ᵇ For rigid Mesh, please specify a surface mesh in an OBJ file in
Mesh(filename). A tetrahedral mesh in a VTK file can also be
specified.
- ᶜ The Convex shape can reference either an .obj or a .vtk tetrahedral
mesh. In both cases, its convex hull will be used to define the
hydroelastic representation.

- We do not support contact between two rigid geometries. One geometry
must* be compliant, and the other could be rigid or compliant. If
two rigid geometries collide, an exception will be thrown. More
particularly, if such a geometry pair *cannot be culled* an exception
will be thrown. No exception is thrown if the pair has been filtered.
- If you need all combinations of rigid-rigid contact, rigid-compliant
contact, and compliant-compliant contact, you might consider

R"""(Computes the signed distance together with the nearest points across
all pairs of geometries in the world. Reports both the separating

This query provides φ(A, B), the signed distance between two objects A
and B.

If the objects do not overlap (i.e., A ⋂ B = ∅), φ > 0 and represents
the minimal distance between the two objects. More formally: φ =
min(|Aₚ - Bₚ|) ∀ Aₚ ∈ A and Bₚ ∈ B.

Note:
    The pair (Aₚ, Bₚ) is a "witness" of the distance. The pair need
    not be unique (think of two parallel planes).

If the objects touch or overlap (i.e., A ⋂ B ≠ ∅), φ ≤ 0 and can be
interpreted as the negative penetration depth. It is the smallest
length of the vector v, such that by shifting one object along that
vector relative to the other, the two objects will no longer be
overlapping. More formally, φ(A, B) = -min |v|. s.t (Tᵥ · A) ⋂ B = ∅
where Tᵥ is a rigid transformation that displaces A by the vector v,
namely Tᵥ · A = {u + v | ∀ u ∈ A}. By implication, there exist points
Aₚ and Bₚ on the surfaces of objects A and B, respectively, such that
Aₚ + v = Bₚ, Aₚ ∈ A ∩ B, Bₚ ∈ A ∩ B. These points are the witnesses to
the penetration.

This method is affected by collision filtering; geometry pairs that
have been filtered will not produce signed distance query results.

For a geometry pair (A, B), the returned results will always be
reported in a fixed order (e.g., always (A, B) and never (B, A)). The
*basis* for the ordering is arbitrary (and therefore undocumented),
but guaranteed to be fixed and repeatable.

Notice that this is an O(N²) operation, where N is the number of
geometries remaining in the world after applying collision filter. We
report the distance between dynamic objects, and between dynamic and
anchored objects. We DO NOT report the distance between two anchored
objects.

**Using maximum distance**

While the algorithm generally has O(N²) complexity in time and space,
that can be reduced by the judicious use of the ``max_distance``
parameter. If ``φ(A, B) > max_distance``, the pair (A, B) will not be
included in the results (making it O(M²) in space where M < N).
Furthermore, the broadphase culling algorithm can exploit
``max_distance`` to *cheaply* eliminate pairs of geometry that are
"obviously" too far (likewise reducing the time complexity).

Passing ``max_distance = 0`` is conceptually related to calling
HasCollisions(). If contact is sparse (very few actually contacting
geometry pairs), the two invocations will be quite similar in cost.
However, the distinction between the two is that *this* method would
have to include *all* pairs that satisfy ``φ(A, B) <= 0``, whereas
HasCollisions() stops at the first. So, the more actually colliding
geometry pairs there are, the bigger the difference in cost between
the two approaches.

**Characterizing the returned values**

As discussed in the query_object_precision_methodology "class's
documentation", this table documents the support given by this query
for pairs of geometry types and scalar. See the description in the
link for details on how to interpret the table results. The query is
symmetric with respect to shape *ordering*, the pair (ShapeA, ShapeB)
will be the same as (ShapeB, ShapeA), so we only fill in half the
table.

**Characterizing the returned gradients**

In most cases, the returned gradient vectors are the normalized
displacement vectors between two witness points. However, when two
geometries touch at zero distance, their witness points have a zero
displacement vector that we cannot normalize.

When two geometries touch at zero distance, we have special
implementation to choose reasonable gradients for some cases shown as
"Ok" in the table below. Otherwise, they are "NaN" in the table. In
general, we try to choose the gradient, when two geometries touch, in
the most consistent way, but the problem sometimes doesn't have a
unique solution. For example, any direction is qualified to be the
gradient for two concentric spheres. Or two boxes touching at their
vertices can pick a gradient from a continuous family of directions.

This query provides φᵢ(p), φᵢ:ℝ³→ℝ, the signed distance to the

an array of the signed distances from all geometries.

Optionally you can specify a threshold distance that will filter out
any object beyond the threshold. By default, we report distances from
the query point to every object.

This query also provides the gradient vector ∇φᵢ(p) of the signed
distance function from geometry Gᵢ. Note that, in general, if p is
outside Gᵢ, then ∇φᵢ(p) equals the unit vector in the direction from
the nearest point Nᵢ on Gᵢ's surface to p. If p is inside Gᵢ, then
∇φᵢ(p) is in the direction from p to Nᵢ. This observation is written
formally as:

∇φᵢ(p) = (p - Nᵢ)/|p - Nᵢ| if p is outside Gᵢ

∇φᵢ(p) = -(p - Nᵢ)/|p - Nᵢ| if p is inside Gᵢ

Note that ∇φᵢ(p) is also defined on Gᵢ's surface, but we cannot use

This table is a variant of that described in this

evaluates signed distance between *one* shape and a point (in contrast
to other queries which involve two shapes). Therefore, we don't need a
matrix of shape pairs, but a list of shapes. Otherwise, the
methodology is the same as described, with the point being represented
as a zero-radius sphere.

- ᵃ Unsupported geometry/scalar combinations are simply ignored; no results
are reported for that geometry.
- ᵇ This uses an *iterative* algorithm which introduces a relatively large
and variable error. For example, as the eccentricity of the ellipsoid
increases, this error may get worse. It also depends on the location of
the projection of the query point on the ellipsoid; the closer that point
is to the high curvature area, the bigger the effect. It is not
immediately clear how much worse the answer will get.
- ᶜ Only supports OBJ and tetrahedral VTK meshes. Unsupported meshes are
simply ignored; no results are reported for that geometry. For OBJ meshes
the surface mesh must satisfy specific requirements (see below). Unlike
the other Shapes, witness points and gradients can be discontinuous on a
mesh's exterior if it is non-convex.

Precondition:
    The Mesh of a triangular surface mesh must be a closed manifold
    without duplicate vertices or self-intersection, and every
    triangle's face winding gives an outward-pointing face normal.
    Drake does not currently validate the input mesh with respect to
    these properties. Instead, it does a good-faith computation
    assuming the properties, possibly returning incorrect results.
    Non-compliant meshes will introduce regions in which the query
    point will report the wrong sign (and, therefore, the wrong
    gradient) due to a misclassification of being inside or outside.
    This leads to discontinuities in the distance field across the
    boundaries of these regions; the distance sign will flip while the
    magnitude of the distance value is arbitrarily far away from zero.
    For open meshes, the same principle holds. The open mesh, which
    has no true concept of "inside", will nevertheless report some
    query points as being inside.

Precondition:
    The Mesh of a tetrahedral volume mesh has positive-volume
    tetrahedra, no duplicate vertices, no self-intersection, and any
    two tetrahedra intersect in a common triangular face, edge, or
    vertex or not at all. A "tetrahedron soup" is, in general,
    non-compliant to this condition. Violating meshes will introduce
    areas inside the volumes that are incorrectly treated as boundary
    surfaces. The query points near such problematic areas will report
    the wrong nearest points, distances, and gradients.

Note:
    For a sphere G, the signed distance function φᵢ(p) has an
    undefined gradient vector at the center of the sphere--every point
    on the sphere's surface has the same distance to the center. In
    this case, we will assign ∇φᵢ(p) the unit vector Gx (x-directional
    vector of G's frame) expressed in World frame.

Note:
    For a box, at a point p on an edge or a corner of the box, the
    signed distance function φᵢ(p) has an undefined gradient vector.
    In this case, we will assign a unit vector in the direction of the
    average of the outward face unit normals of the incident faces of
    the edge or the corner. A point p is considered being on a face,
    or an edge, or a corner of the box if it lies within a certain
    tolerance from them.

Note:
    For a box B, if a point p is inside the box, and it is equidistant
    to multiple nearest faces, the signed distance function φᵢ(p) at p
    will have an undefined gradient vector. There is a nearest point
    candidate associated with each nearest face. In this case, we
    arbitrarily pick the point Nᵢ associated with one of the nearest
    faces. Please note that, due to the possible round off error
    arising from applying a pose X_WG to B, there is no guarantee
    which of the nearest faces will be used.

Note:
    The signed distance function is a continuous function with respect
    to the position of the query point, but its gradient vector field
    may not be continuous. Specifically at a position equidistant to
    multiple nearest points, its gradient vector field is not
    continuous.

Note:
    For a convex object, outside the object at positive distance from
    the boundary, the signed distance function is smooth (having
    continuous first-order partial derivatives).

Parameter ``p_WQ``:
    Position of a query point Q in world frame W.

    We ignore any object beyond this distance. By default, it is
    infinity, so we report distances from the query point to every
    object.

operations) in a Diagram. Through SceneGraph, other systems that
introduce geometry can *register* that geometry as part of a common
global domain, including it in geometric queries (e.g., cars
controlled by one LeafSystem can be observed by a different sensor
system). SceneGraph provides the interface for registering the
geometry, updating its position based on the current context, and
performing geometric queries.

.. pydrake_system::

    name: SceneGraph
    input_ports:
    - <em style="color:gray">(source name)</em>_pose
    - <em style="color:gray">(source name)</em>_configuration
    output_ports:
    - query

For each registered "geometry source", there is an input port whose
name begins with <em style="color:gray">(source name)</em>.

Only registered "geometry sources" can introduce geometry into
SceneGraph. Geometry sources will typically be other leaf systems,
but, in the case of *anchored* (i.e., stationary) geometry, it could
also be some other block of code (e.g., adding a common ground plane
with which all systems' geometries interact). For dynamic geometry
(geometry whose pose depends on a Context), the geometry source must
also provide pose/configuration values for all of the geometries the
source owns, via a port connection on SceneGraph. For N geometry
sources, the SceneGraph instance will have N pose/configuration input
ports.

The basic workflow for interacting with SceneGraph is:

- Register as a geometry source, acquiring a unique SourceId.
- Register geometry (anchored and dynamic) with the system.
- Connect source's geometry output ports to the corresponding SceneGraph
input ports.
- Implement appropriate ``Calc*`` methods on the geometry output ports to
update geometry pose/configuration values.

Inputs
======

For each registered geometry source, there is one input port for each
order of kinematics values (i.e., pose and configuration). If a source
registers a frame or a deformable geometry, it must connect to the
corresponding ports. Failure to connect to the ports (or to provide
valid kinematics values) will lead to runtime exceptions.

**pose port**: An abstract-valued port providing an instance of
FramePoseVector. For each registered frame, this "pose vector" maps
the registered FrameId to a pose value. All registered frames must be
accounted for and only frames registered by a source can be included
in its output port. See the details in KinematicsVector for details on
how to provide values for this port.

**configuration port**: An abstract-valued port providing an instance
of GeometryConfigurationVector. For each registered deformable
geometry, this "configuration vector" maps the registered GeometryId
to its world space configuration (i.e. the vertex positions of its
mesh representation in the world frame). All registered deformable
geometries must be accounted for and only geometries registered by a
source can be included in its output port.

Outputs
=======

SceneGraph has one output port:

**query port**: An abstract-valued port containing an instance of
QueryObject. To perform geometric queries, downstream LeafSystem
instances acquire the QueryObject from SceneGraph's output port and
invoke the appropriate methods on it. Use get_query_output_port() to
acquire the output port for the query handle.

Working with SceneGraph
=======================

LeafSystem instances can relate to SceneGraph in one of two ways: as a
*consumer* that performs queries, or as a *producer* that introduces
geometry into the shared world and defines its context-dependent
kinematics values. It is reasonable for systems to perform either role
singly, or both.

**Consumer**

Consumers perform geometric queries upon the world geometry.
SceneGraph *serves* those queries. As indicated above, in order for a
LeafSystem to act as a consumer, it must: 1. define a
QueryObject-valued input port and connect it to SceneGraph's
corresponding output port, and 2. have a reference to the connected
SceneGraph instance.

With those two requirements satisfied, a LeafSystem can perform
geometry queries by: 1. evaluating the QueryObject input port,
retrieving a ``const QueryObject&`` in return, and 2. invoking the
appropriate method on the QueryObject.

**Producer**

All producers introduce geometry into the shared geometric world. This
is called *registering* geometry. Depending on what exactly has been
registered, a producer may also have to *update kinematics*. Producers
themselves must be registered with SceneGraph as producers (a.k.a.
*geometry sources*). They do this by acquiring a SourceId (via
SceneGraph::RegisterSource()). The SourceId serves as a unique handle
through which the producer's identity is validated.

*Registering Geometry*

SceneGraph cannot know what geometry *should* be part of the shared
world. Other systems are responsible for introducing geometry into the
world. This process (defining geometry and informing SceneGraph) is
called *registering* the geometry. Geometry can be registered as
*anchored* or *dynamic*, and is always registered to (associated with)
a SourceId.

Dynamic geometry can move; more specifically, its kinematics (e.g.,
pose) depends on a system's Context. Particularly, a non-deformable
dynamic geometry is *fixed* to a *frame* whose kinematics values
depend on a context. As the frame moves, the geometries fixed to it
move with it. On the other hand, a deformable dynamic geometry has a
mesh representation whose vertices' positions can change and are
expressed in the frame it is registered in. Therefore, to register
dynamic geometry a frame must be registered first. These registered
frames serve as the basis for repositioning geometry in the shared
world. The geometry source is responsible for providing up-to-date
kinematics values for those registered frames upon request (via an
appropriate output port on the source LeafSystem connecting to the
appropriate input port on SceneGraph). The geometry source that
registers deformable geometry is also responsible to provide the
positions of the mesh vertices of the deformable geometry in the
registered-in frame. The work flow is as follows: 1. A LeafSystem
registers itself as a geometry source, acquiring a SourceId
(RegisterSource()). 2. The source registers a frame
(GeometrySource::RegisterFrame()). - A frame always has a "parent"
frame. It can implicitly be the world frame, *or* another frame
registered by the source. 3. Register one or more non-deformable
geometries to a frame (RegisterGeometry()), and/or one or more
deformable geometries to a frame (RegisterDeformableGeometry()). - A
non-deformable geometry's pose is relative to the frame to which the
geometry is fixed. For deformable geometries, the positions of their
mesh vertices are expressed in the registered-in frame. - Rigid
geometries can also be posed relative to another registered geometry.
It will be affixed to *that* geometry's frame.

Anchored geometry is *independent* of the context (i.e., it doesn't
move). Anchored geometries are always affixed to the immobile world
frame. As such, registering a frame is *not* required for registering
anchored geometry (see GeometrySource::RegisterAnchoredGeometry()).
However, the source still "owns" the anchored geometry.

*Updating Kinematics*

Registering *dynamic* non-deformable geometry implies a contract
between the geometry source and SceneGraph. The geometry source must
do the following: - It must provide, populate, and connect two output
ports: the "id" port and the "pose" port. - The id port must contain
*all* the frame ids returned as a result of frame registration. - The
pose port must contain one pose per registered frame; the pose value
is expressed relative to the registered frame's *parent* frame. As
mentioned above, the iᵗʰ pose value should describe the frame
indicated by the iᵗʰ id in the id output port.

Similarly, if it registers deformable geometries, the geometry source
must provide, populate, and connect the "configuration" port. The
configuration port must contain a vector of vertex positions per
registered deformable geometry.

Failure to meet these requirements will lead to a run-time error.

Model versus Context
====================

Many (and eventually all) methods that configure the population of
SceneGraph have two variants that differ by whether they accept a
mutable Context or not. When no Context is provided, *this* SceneGraph
instance's underlying model is modified. When the SceneGraph instance
allocates a context, its model is copied into that context.

The second variant causes SceneGraph to modify the data stored in the
provided Context to be modified *instead of the internal model*.

The two interfaces *can* be used interchangeably. However,
modifications to ``this`` SceneGraph's underlying model will *not*
affect previously allocated Context instances. A new Context should be
allocated after modifying the model.

Note:
    In this initial version, the only methods with the
    Context-modifying variant are those methods that *do not* change
    the semantics of the input or output ports. Modifications that
    make such changes must be coordinated across systems.

Detecting changes
=================

The geometry data associated with SceneGraph is coarsely versioned.
Consumers of the geometry can query for the version of the data and
recognize if the data has been modified since last examined.

The versioning is associated with geometry roles: proximity,
illustration, and perception; each role has its own, independent
version. Any operation that affects geometry with one of those roles
will modify the corresponding version. For example:

In C++:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    // Does *not* modify any version; no roles have been assigned.
    const GeometryId geometry_id = scene_graph.RegisterGeometry(
    source_id, frame_id, make_unique<GeometryInstance>(...));
    // Modifies the proximity version.
    scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, ProximityProperties());
    // Modifies the illustration version.
    scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, IllustrationProperties());
    // Modifies the perception version if there exists a renderer that accepts the
    // geometry.
    scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, PerceptionProperties());
    // Modifies the illustration version.
    scene_graph.RemoveRole(source_id, geometry_id, Role::kIllustration);
    // Modifies proximity version and perception version if the geometry is
    // registered with any renderer.
    scene_graph.RemoveGeometry(source_id, geometry_id);

.. raw:: html

    </details>

In Python:


.. code-block:: python

    # Does *not* modify any version; no roles have been assigned.
    geometry_id = scene_graph.RegisterGeometry(
    source_id, frame_id, GeometryInstance(...))
    # Modifies the proximity version.
    scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, ProximityProperties())
    # Modifies the illustration version.
    scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, IllustrationProperties())
    # Modifies the perception version if there exists a renderer that accepts the
    # geometry.
    scene_graph.AssignRole(source_id, geometry_id, PerceptionProperties())
    # Modifies the illustration version.
    scene_graph.RemoveRole(source_id, geometry_id, Role.kIllustration)
    # Modifies proximity version and perception version if the geometry is
    # registered with any renderer.
    scene_graph.RemoveGeometry(source_id, geometry_id)

Each copy of geometry data maintains its own set of versions.
SceneGraph's model has its own version, and that version is the same
as the version in the Context provided by
SceneGraph::CreateDefaultContext(). Modifications to the geometry data
contained in a Context modifies *that* data's version, but the
original model data's version is unmodified, reflecting the unchanged
model data.

The geometry data's version is accessed via a SceneGraphInspector
instance. model_inspector() will give access to SceneGraph's model
version. And QueryObject::inspector() will give access to the geometry
data stored in a Context.

Current versions can be compared against previously examined versions.
If the versions match, then the geometry data is guaranteed to be the
same. If they don't match, that indicates that the two sets of data
underwent different revision processes. That, however, doesn't
necessarily imply that the two sets of data are distinct. In other
words, the versioning will report a difference unless it can guarantee
equivalence.

It is possible that two different contexts have different versions and
a downstream system can be evaluated with each context alternatingly.
If the system behavior depends on the geometry version, this will
cause it to thrash whatever components depends on geometry version.
The system should *clearly* document this fact.)""";

should be referenced in the render::ColorRenderCamera

an example).

There is no restriction on when a renderer is added relative to
geometry registration and role assignment. Given a representative
sequence of registration and perception role assignment, the addition
of the renderer can be introduced anywhere in the sequence and the end
result would be the same.

- hierarchies (parents of geometries, parents of frames, etc.)
- geometry parameters (e.g., contact, rendering, visualization)

In contrast, the following pieces of data *do* depend on input pose
data and *cannot* be performed with the SceneGraphInspector (see the

- world pose of frames or geometry
- collision queries
- proximity queries
