R"""(Interface for collision checkers to use.

This interface builds on the basic multi-threading idiom of Drake: one
context per thread. It offers two models to achieve multi-threaded
parallel collision checking:

- using thread pools (e.g. OpenMP or similar) and "implicit contexts" managed
by this object
- using arbitrary threads and "explicit contexts" created by this object

<h5>Implicit Context Parallelism</h5>

Many methods of this class aren't designed for entry from arbitrary
threads (e.g. from std::async threads), but rather are designed for
use with a main thread and various thread-pool-parallel operations
achieved by using directives like ``omp parallel``. To support this
usage, the base class ``AllocateContexts()`` protected method
establishes a pool of contexts to support the implicit context
parallelism specified in the constructor. (Note: if the collision
checker declares that parallel checking is not supported, only one
implict context will be allocated). ``AllocateContexts()`` must be
called and only be called as part of the constructor of a derived
class defined as final.

Once the context pool is created, clients can access a
thread-associated context by using ``model_context(optional<int>
context_number)`` and related methods. These methods may be called in
two ways:

- without a context number, the association between thread and context uses the
OpenMP notion of thread number
- with a context number, the method uses the context corresponding to the
provided number

Without a context number, these context access methods are only safe
under the following conditions:

- the caller is the "main thread"
- the caller is an OpenMP team thread *during execution of a parallel region*

With a context number, these context access methods are only safe
under the following conditions:

- no two or more threads simultaneously use the same context number

Methods supporting implicit context parallelism are noted below by
having a reference to this section; as a rule of thumb, any public
method that takes a ``context_number`` argument uses implicit context
parallelism.

Users of this class (derived classes and others) can write their own
parallel operations using implicit contexts, provided they limit
parallel blocks to only use ``const`` methods or methods marked to
support implicit contexts parallelism, and the parallel operations
are:

- without a context number, only with parallelism using OpenMP directives
- with a context number, via a parallelization method that provides a notion of
thread numbers similar in behavior to OpenMP's (i.e. a thread number in
[0, number of threads), not arbitrary values like
``std::this_thread::get_id()``)

To determine the greatest implicit context parallelism that can be
achieved in a parallelized operation, ``GetNumberOfThreads(Parallelism
parallelize)`` returns the lesser of the provided ``parallelism`` and
the supported implicit context parallelism.

<h5>Explicit Context Parallelism</h5>

It is also possible to use arbitrary thread models to perform
collision checking in parallel using explicitly created contexts from
this class. Contexts returned from MakeStandaloneModelContext() may be
used in any thread, using only ``const`` methods of this class, or
"explicit context" methods.

Explicit contexts are tracked by this class using ``std::weak_ptr`` to
track their lifetimes. This mechanism is used by
PerformOperationAgainstAllModelContexts to map an operation over all
collision contexts, whether explicit or implicit.

Methods supporting explicit context parallelism are noted below by
having a reference to this section; as a rule of thumb, any public
method that takes a ``model_context`` first argument uses explicit
context parallelism.

In practice, multi-threaded collision checking with explicit contexts
may look something like the example below.

<h5>Mixing Threading Models</h5>

It is possible to support mixed threading models, i.e., using both
OpenMP thread pools and arbitrary threads. In this case, each
arbitrary thread (say, from std::async) should have its own instance
of a collision checker made using Clone(). Then each arbitrary thread
will have its own implicit context pool.

<h5>Implementing Derived Classes</h5>

Collision checkers deriving from CollisionChecker *must* support
parallel operations from both of the above parallelism models. This is
generally accomplished by placing all mutable state within the
per-thread context. If this cannot be accomplished, the shared mutable
state must be accessed in a thread-safe manner. There are APIs that
depend on SupportsParallelChecking() (e.g.,
CheckConfigsCollisionFree(), CheckEdgeCollisionFreeParallel(),
CheckEdgesCollisionFree(), etc); a derived implementation should
return ``False`` from SupportsParallelChecking() if there is no
meaningful benefit to attempting to do work in parallel (e.g., they
must fully serialize on shared state).)""";

distance and interpolation operations, used by CollisionChecker. See
LinearDistanceAndInterpolationProvider for an implementation covering
common "linear" distance and interpolation behavior.

Configuration distance and interpolation are necessary for a
CollisionChecker to perform edge collision checks, and an essential
part of many motion planning problems. The C-spaces for many planning
problems combine joints with widely differing effects (e.g. for a
given angular change, the shoulder joint of a robot arm results in
much more significant motion than the same change on a finger joint)
or units (e.g. a mobile robot with translation in meters and yaw in
radians). As a result, it is often necessary to weight elements of the
configuration differently when computing configuration distance.

Likewise, in more complex C-spaces, it may be necessary to perform
more complex interpolation behavior (e.g. when planning for a mobile
robot whose motion is modelled via Dubbins or Reeds-Shepp paths).

Configuration distance takes two configurations of the robot, from and
to, both as Eigen::VectorXd, and returns (potentially weighted)
C-space distance as a double. The returned distance will be strictly
non-negative.

To be valid, distance must satisfy the following condition:

- ComputeConfigurationDistance(q, q) ≡ 0

for values of q that are valid for the C-space in use.

Configuration interpolation takes two configurations of the robot,
from and to, both as Eigen::VectorXd, plus a ratio in [0, 1] and
returns the interpolated configuration.

between the robot and everything in the world. This data can be used

Conceptually, this class represents a table:

| body index R | body index O | type | ϕᴼ(R) | Jq_ϕᴼ(R) | |
:----------: | :----------: | :--: | :---: | :------: | | ... | ... |
.. | ... | ... |

Member functions return each column of the table as an ordered
collection. The iᵗʰ entry in each collection belongs to the iᵗʰ row.

Each row characterizes the relationship between a particular *robot*
body (annotated as body R) and some "other" body (annotated as body O)
in the model. That other body O may be part of the robot or the
environment.

- ``body index R`` is the BodyIndex of body R.
- ``body index O`` is the BodyIndex of body O.
- ``type`` implies the type of body O. Given that we know body R is a robot
body, ``type`` indicates that body O is also a robot body with the value
RobotCollisionType::kSelfCollision or an environment body with the value
RobotCollisionType::kEnvironmentCollision. For a correct implementation of
CollisionChecker, it will never be
RobotCollisionType::kEnvironmentAndSelfCollision.
- ``ϕᴼ(R)`` is the signed distance function of the other body O evaluated on
body R. The reported distance is offset by the padding value for the body
pair recorded in the CollisionChecker. It is the minimum padded distance
between bodies O and R. A point on the padded surface of body O would
report a distance of zero. Points inside that boundary report negative
distance and points outside have positive distance.
- ``Jqᵣ_ϕᴼ(R)`` is the Jacobian of ϕᴼ(R) with respect to the robot
configuration vector ``qᵣ``. The Jacobian is the derivative as observed in
the world frame.
- The vector ``qᵣ`` will be a subset of the plant's full configuration ``q``
when there are floating bodies or joints in the plant other than the
robot. The Jacobian is only taken with respect to the robot.
- The ``jacobians()`` matrix has ``plant.num_positions()`` columns and the
column order matches up with the full ``plant.GetPositions()`` order.
The columns associated with non-robot joints will be zero.

Several important notes:

- A single robot body index can appear many times as there may be many
measured distances between that robot body and other bodies in the model.
- A row *may* contain a zero-valued Jacobian Jqᵣ_ϕᴼ(R). Appropriately
filtering collisions will cull most of these Jacobians. But depending on
the structure of the robot and its representative collision geometry, it
is still possible to evaluate the Jacobian at a configuration that
represents a local optimum (zero-valued Jacobian).)""";

This class is a convenient syntactic sugar, especially in C++ code

For other purposes (e.g., simulation), users should generally prefer
to just use a Diagram, instead.

Use RobotDiagramBuilder to construct a RobotDiagram.

By default, the ports exposed by a RobotDiagram are the set of all
ports provided by the plant and scene graph (excluding the internal
connections between the two). Refer to their individual overview

have an edge between them if the line segment connecting them is

Note that this method assumes the collision checker has symmetric
behavior (i.e. checking edge (q1, q2) is the same as checking edge
(q2, q1)). This is true for many collision checkers (e.g. those using
LinearDistanceAndInterpolationProvider, which is the default), but
some more complex spaces with non-linear interpolation (e.g. a Dubin's
car) are not symmetric.

If ``parallelize`` specifies more than one thread, then the
CollisionCheckerParams::distance_and_interpolation_provider for
``checker`` must be implemented in C++, either by providing the C++
implementation directly directly or by using the default provider.

Returns:
    the adjacency matrix, A(i,j) == true iff points.col(i) is visible
    from points.col(j). A is always symmetric.
