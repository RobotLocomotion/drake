We use two different encoding schemes on the binary variables, to
determine which interval is active. We can choose either linear or
logarithmic binning. When using linear binning, for a variable with N
intervals, we use N binary variables, and B(i) = 1 indicates the
variable is in the i'th interval. When using logarithmic binning, we
use ⌈log₂(N)⌉ binary variables. If these binary variables represent
integer M in the reflected Gray code, then the continuous variable is
in the M'th interval.

2. Ideally, we would like to enforce z₁ = xᵀQ₁x and z₂ = xᵀQ₂x through convex
   constraints. To this end, we first bound z₁ and z₂ from below, as

These two constraints are second order cone constraints. 3. To bound
z₁ and z₂ from above, we linearize the quadratic forms xᵀQ₁x and xᵀQ₂x
at a point x₀. Due to the convexity of the quadratic form, we know
that given a positive scalar d > 0, there exists a neighbourhood N(x₀)
around x₀, s.t ∀ x ∈ N(x₀)

So we relax the original non-convex constraint, with the convex
constraints (1)-(3), (6) and (7).

The trust region is the neighbourhood N(x₀) around x₀, such that the
inequalities (4), (5) are satisfied ∀ x ∈ N(x₀).

The positive scalar d controls both how much the constraint relaxation
is (the original constraint can be violated by at most d), and how big
the trust region is.

If there is a solution satisfying the relaxed constraint, this
solution can violate the original non-convex constraint by at most d;
on the other hand, if there is not a solution satisfying the relaxed
constraint, it proves that the original non-convex constraint does not
have a solution in the trust region.

This approach is outlined in section III of On Time Optimization of
Centroidal Momentum Dynamics by Brahayam Ponton, Alexander Herzog,
Stefan Schaal and Ludovic Righetti, ICRA, 2018

The special cases are when Q₁ = 0 or Q₂ = 0. 1. When Q₁ = 0, the
original constraint becomes lb ≤ -xᵀQ₂x + pᵀy ≤ ub If ub = +∞, then
the original constraint is the convex rotated Lorentz cone constraint
xᵀQ₂x ≤ pᵀy - lb. The user should not call this function to relax this
convex constraint.

Raises:

    xᵀQ₂x z ≤ 2 x₀ᵀQ₂(x - x₀) + x₀ᵀQ₂x₀ + d 2. When Q₂ = 0, the
    constraint becomes lb ≤ xᵀQ₁x + pᵀy ≤ ub If lb = -∞, then the
    original constraint is the convex rotated Lorentz cone constraint
    xᵀQ₁x ≤ ub - pᵀy. The user should not call this function to relax
    this convex constraint.

Raises:

    a new variable z, with the constraints lb ≤ z + pᵀy ≤ ub z ≥ xᵀQ₁x
    z ≤ 2 x₀ᵀQ₁(x - x₀) + x₀ᵀQ₁x₀ + d 3. If both Q₁ and Q₂ are zero,
    then the original constraint is a convex linear constraint lb ≤

R"""(Adds binary variables that constrain the value of the column *and* row
vectors of R, in order to add the following (in some cases non-convex)
constraints as an MILP. Specifically, for column vectors Ri, we
constrain:

- forall i, |Ri| = 1 ± envelope,
- forall i,j. i ≠ j, Ri.dot(Rj) = 0 ± envelope,
- R2 = R0.cross(R1) ± envelope,
     and again for R0=R1.cross(R2), and R1=R2.cross(R0).

Then all of the same constraints are also added to R^T. The size of
the envelope decreases quickly as num_binary_variables_per_half_axis
is is increased.

Note:
    Creates ``9*2*num_binary_variables_per_half_axis binary``
    variables named "BRpos*(*,*)" and "BRneg*(*,*)", and the same
    number of continuous variables named "CRpos*(*,*)" and
    "CRneg*(*,*)".

Note:
    The particular representation/algorithm here was developed in an
    attempt: - to enable efficient reuse of the variables between the
    constraints between multiple rows/columns (e.g. the constraints on
    Rᵀ use the same variables as the constraints on R), and - to
    facilitate branch-and-bound solution techniques -- binary regions
    are layered so that constraining one region establishes
    constraints on large portions of SO(3), and confers hopefully
    "useful" constraints the on other binary variables.

Parameter ``R``:
    The rotation matrix

Parameter ``num_intervals_per_half_axis``:
    number of intervals for a half axis.

Parameter ``prog``:
    The mathematical program to which the constraints are added.

Note:
    This method uses the same approach as
    MixedIntegerRotationConstraintGenerator with

details, refer to the documentation at
https://drake.mit.edu/bazel.html#proprietary-solvers.

The GRB_LICENSE_FILE environment variable controls whether or not
SolverInterface::enabled() returns true. If it is set to any non-empty
value, then the solver is enabled; otherwise, the solver is not
enabled.

Gurobi solver supports options/parameters listed in
https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/12.0/concepts/parameters.html.
On top of these options, we provide the following additional options
1. "GRBwrite", set to a file name so that Gurobi solver will write the
optimization model to this file, check
https://www.docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/12.0/reference/python/model.html#Write
for more details, such as all supported file extensions. Set this
option to "" if you don't want to write to file. Default is not to
write to a file. 2. "GRBcomputeIIS", set to 1 to compute an
Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS) when the problem is
infeasible. Refer to
https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/12.0/reference/python/model.html#Model.computeIIS
for more details. Often this method is called together with setting
GRBwrite to "FILENAME.ilp" to write IIS to a file with extension
"ilp". Default is not to compute IIS.

GurobiSolver supports parallelization during Solve(). If both the
"Threads" integer solver option and CommonSolverOption::kMaxThreads
have been set by the user, then the value in "Threads" will be used as
the number of threads.

If neither the "Threads" integer solver option nor
CommonSolverOption::kMaxThreads has been set by the user, then
GurobiSolver uses the environment variable GUROBI_NUM_THREADS (if set)
as a default value for "Threads".

GUROBI_NUM_THREADS are set, then Drake's default maximum parallelism

sparsity of the relaxation.

For each group in ``variable_groups``, the costs and constraints whose
variables are a subset of the group will be jointly relaxed into a
single, dense semidefinite program in the same manner as
MakeSemidefiniteRelaxation(prog).

Each of these semidefinite relaxations are aggregated into a single
program, and their semidefinite variables are made to agree where the
variable groups overlap.

The returned program will always have the same number of PSD variables
as variable groups.

Costs and constraints whose variables are not a subset of any of the
groups are not relaxed and are simply added to the aggregated program.
If these costs and constraints are non-convex, then this method will
throw.

As an example, consider the following program. min x₂ᵀ * Q * x₂
subject to x₁ + x₂ ≤ 1 x₂ + x₃ ≤ 2 x₁ + x₃ ≤ 3

And suppose we call MakeSemidefiniteRelaxation(prog,
std::vector<Variables>{{x₁, x₂}, {x₂,x₃}}).

The resulting relaxation would have two semidefinite variables,
namely: [U₁, U₂, x₁] [W₁, W₂, x₂] [U₂, U₃, x₂], [W₂, W₃, x₃] [x₁ᵀ,
x₂ᵀ, 1] [x₂ᵀ, x₃ᵀ, 1]

The first semidefinite variable would be associated to the
semidefinite relaxation of the subprogram: min x₁ᵀ * Q * x₁ subject to
x₁ + x₂ ≤ 1 And the implied constraints from x₁ + x₂ ≤ 1 would be
added to the first semidefinite variable. These implied constraints
are additional constraints that can be placed on the matrix [U₁, U₂,
x₁] [U₂, U₃, x₂] [x₁ᵀ, x₂ᵀ, 1] which are redundant in the non-convex
program, but are not redundant in the semidefinite relaxation. See
https://underactuated.mit.edu/optimization.html#sdp_relaxation for
references and examples.

The second semidefinite variable would be associated to the
semidefinite relaxation of the subprogram: min x₂ᵀ * Q * x₂ subject to
x₂ + x₃ ≤ 2 And the implied constraints from x₂ + x₃ ≤ 2 would be
added to the second semidefinite variable.

Since the constraint x₁ + x₃ ≤ 3 is not a subset of any of the
variable groups, it will be added to the overall relaxation, but will
not be used to generate implied constraints on any semidefinite
variable.

The total relaxation would also include an equality constraint that U₃
== W₁ so that the quadratic relaxation of x₂ is consistent between the
two semidefinite variables.

Note: 1) Costs are only associated to a single variable group, so that
the resulting aggregated program has a relaxed cost with the same
scaling. 2) The homogenization variable "1" is re-used in every
semidefinite variable.

For constraints in the form lower <= f(x) <= upper (including linear
inequality, linear equality, bounding box constraints, and general
nonlinear constraints), we interpret the dual variable value as the
"shadow price" of the original problem. Namely if we change the
constraint bound by one unit (each unit is infinitesimally small), the
change of the optimal cost is the value of the dual solution times the
unit. Mathematically dual_solution = ∂optimal_cost / ∂bound.

For a linear equality constraint Ax = b where b ∈ ℝⁿ, the vector of
dual variables has n rows, and dual_solution(i) is the value of the
dual variable for the constraint A(i,:)*x = b(i).

For a linear inequality constraint lower <= A*x <= upper where lower
and upper ∈ ℝⁿ, dual_solution also has n rows. dual_solution(i) is the
value of the dual variable for constraint lower(i) <= A(i,:)*x <=
upper(i). If neither side of the constraint is active, then
dual_solution(i) is 0. If the left hand-side lower(i) <= A(i, :)*x is
active (meaning lower(i) = A(i, :)*x at the solution), then
dual_solution(i) is non-negative (because the objective is to minimize
a cost, increasing the lower bound means the constraint set is
tighter, hence the optimal solution cannot decrease. Thus the shadow
price is non-negative). If the right hand-side A(i, :)*x<=upper(i) is
active (meaning A(i,:)*x=upper(i) at the solution), then
dual_solution(i) is non-positive.

For a bounding box constraint lower <= x <= upper, the interpretation
of the dual solution is the same as the linear inequality constraint.

For a Lorentz cone or rotated Lorentz cone constraint that Ax + b is
in the cone, depending on the solver, the dual solution has different
meanings: 1. If the solver is Gurobi, then the user can only obtain
the dual solution by explicitly setting the options for computing dual
solution.

The dual solution has size 1, dual_solution(0) is the shadow price for
the constraint z₁² + ... +zₙ² ≤ z₀² for Lorentz cone constraint, and
the shadow price for the constraint z₂² + ... +zₙ² ≤ z₀z₁ for rotated
Lorentz cone constraint, where z is the slack variable representing z
= A*x+b and z in the Lorentz cone/rotated Lorentz cone. 2. For
nonlinear solvers like IPOPT, the dual solution for Lorentz cone
constraint (with EvalType::kConvex) is the shadow price for z₀ -
sqrt(z₁² + ... +zₙ²) ≥ 0, where z = Ax+b. 3. For other convex conic
solver such as SCS, MOSEK™, CSDP, etc, the dual solution to the
(rotated) Lorentz cone constraint doesn't have the "shadow price"
interpretation, but should lie in the dual cone, and satisfy the KKT
condition. For more information, refer to
https://docs.mosek.com/11.1/capi/prob-def-conic.html#duality-for-conic-optimization
as an explanation.

The interpretation for the dual variable to conic constraint x ∈ K can
be different. Here K is a convex cone, including exponential cone,
power cone, psd cone, etc. When the problem is solved by a convex
solver (like SCS, MOSEK™, CSDP, etc), often it has a dual variable z ∈
K*, where K* is the dual cone. Here the dual variable DOESN'T have the
interpretation of "shadow price", but should satisfy the KKT
condition, while the dual variable stays inside the dual cone.

When K is a psd cone, the returned dual solution is the lower triangle
of the dual symmetric psd matrix. Namely for the primal problem

min trace(C*X) s.t A(X) = b X is psd

the dual is

max b'*y s.t A'(y) - C = Z Z is psd.

We return the lower triangular part of Z. You can call
drake::math::ToSymmetricMatrixFromLowerTriangularColumns to get the
matrix Z.)""";

To relax SO(3) constraint on rotation matrix R, we divide the range
[-1, 1] (the range of each entry in R) into smaller intervals [φ(i),
φ(i+1)], and then relax the SO(3) constraint within each interval. We
provide 3 approaches for relaxation 1. By replacing each bilinear
product in constraint (1), (2) and (3) with a new variable, in the

(where M ∈ ℝⁿˣⁿ and q ∈ ℝⁿ are problem inputs and z ∈ ℝⁿ and w ∈ ℝⁿ
are unknown vectors) or correctly reporting that such a solution does
not exist. In spite of their linear structure, solving LCPs is NP-Hard
[Cottle 1992]. However, some LCPs are significantly easier to solve.
For instance, it can be seen that the LCP is solvable in worst-case
polynomial time for the case of symmetric positive-semi-definite M by
formulating it as the following convex quadratic program:

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

Note that this quadratic program's (QP) objective function at the
minimum z cannot be less than zero, and the LCP is only solved if the
objective function at the minimum is equal to zero. Since the seminal
result of Karmarkar, it has been known that convex QPs are solvable in
polynomial time [Karmarkar 1984].

The difficulty of solving an LCP is characterized by the properties of
its particular matrix, namely the class of matrices it belongs to.
Classes include, for example, Q, Q₀, P, P₀, copositive, and Z
matrices. [Cottle 1992] and [Murty 1998] (see pp. 224-230 in the
latter) describe relevant matrix classes in more detail.

Therefore, q is in the range of P and M is positive semi-definite. An
LCP of this form is also guaranteed to have a solution [Cottle 1992].

This particular implementation focuses on the case where the solution
requires few nonzero nonbasic variables, meaning that few z variables
need be nonzero to find a solution to Mz + q = w. This algorithm,
which is based off of Dantzig's Principle Pivoting Method I [Cottle
1992] is described in [Drumwright 2015]. This algorithm is able to use
"warm" starting- a solution to a "nearby" LCP can be used to find the
solution to a given LCP more quickly.

Although this solver is theoretically guaranteed to give a solution to
the LCPs described above, accumulated floating point error from
pivoting operations could cause the solver to fail. Additionally, the
solver can be applied with some success to problems outside of its
guaranteed matrix class. For these reasons, the solver returns a flag
indicating success/failure.

Parameter ``M``:
    the LCP matrix.

Parameter ``q``:
    the LCP vector.

Parameter ``z``:
    the solution to the LCP on return (if the solver succeeds). If the
    length of z is equal to the length of q, the solver will attempt
    to use z's value as a starting solution. If the solver fails
    (returns ``False``), `z` will be set to the zero vector.

Parameter ``zero_tol``:
    The tolerance for testing against zero. If the tolerance is
    negative (default) the solver will determine a generally
    reasonable tolerance.

Raises:
    RuntimeError if M is non-square or M's dimensions do not equal q's
    dimension.

Returns:

Drake downloads and builds MOSEK™ automatically, but to enable it you
must set the location of your license file as described in the
documentation at https://drake.mit.edu/bazel.html#mosek.

The MOSEKLM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable controls whether or not
SolverInterface::enabled() returns true. Iff it is set to any
non-empty value, then the solver is enabled; otherwise, the solver is
not enabled.

Note:
    MOSEK™ only cares about the initial guess of integer variables.
    The initial guess of continuous variables are not passed to
    MOSEK™. If all the integer variables are set to some integer
    values, then MOSEK™ will be forced to compute the remaining
    continuous variable values as the initial guess. (MOSEK™ might
    change the values of the integer/binary variables in the
    subsequent iterations.) If the specified integer solution is
    infeasible or incomplete, MOSEK™ will simply ignore it. For more
    details, check
    https://docs.mosek.com/11.1/capi/tutorial-mio-shared.html?highlight=initial

MOSEK™ supports many solver parameters. You can refer to the full list
of parameters in
https://docs.mosek.com/11.1/capi/param-groups.html#doc-param-groups.
On top of these parameters, we also provide the following additional
parameters

- "writedata"
   set to a file name so that MOSEK™ solver will write the
   optimization model to this file. check
   https://docs.mosek.com/11.1/capi/solver-io.html#saving-a-problem-to-a-file
   for more details. The supported file extensions are listed in
   https://docs.mosek.com/11.1/capi/supported-file-formats.html#doc-shared-file-formats.
   Set this parameter to "" if you don't want to write to a file. Default is
   not to write to a file.)""";

OSQP's default values for all options except following: - Drake
defaults to ``polish=true`` (upstream default is ``False``). - Drake
defaults to ``adaptive_rho_interval=ADAPTIVE_RHO_FIXED`` to make the
output deterministic (upstream default is ``0``, which uses
non-deterministic timing measurements to establish the interval). N.B.
Generally the interval should be an integer multiple of
``check_termination``, so if you choose to override either option you
should probably override both at once.

variables, namely problems in this form P2

max tr(C * X) + dᵀs s.t tr(Aᵢ*X) + bᵢᵀs = aᵢ X ≽ 0 s is free.

In order to remove the free variables, we consider three approaches.
1. Replace a free variable s with two variables s = p - q, p ≥ 0, q ≥

min aᵀy s.t ∑ᵢ yᵢAᵢ - C = Z Z ≽ 0 Bᵀ * y = d,

where bᵢᵀ is the i'th row of B. The last constraint Bᵀ * y = d means y
= ŷ + Nt, where Bᵀ * ŷ = d, and N is the null space of Bᵀ. Hence, D2
is equivalent to the following problem, D3

is selected for progs[i] depending on the availability of the solver

done for every progs[i].

Uses at most parallelism cores, with static scheduling by default.

Parameter ``dynamic_schedule``:
    If dynamic_schedule is false then static scheduling is used and so
    each core will solve approximately 1/parallelism of the programs.
    This is most efficient when all the programs take approximately
    the same amount of time to solve. If dynamic_schedule is true,
    then dynamic scheduling is used and all the programs are queued
    into a single pool and each core will take the next program off
    the queue when it becomes available. This is best when each
    program takes a dramatically different amount of time to solve.

Note:
    When using a proprietary solver (e.g. Mosek) your organization may
    have limited license seats. It is recommended that the number of
    parallel solves does not exceed the total number of license seats.

Note:
    Only programs which are thread safe are solved concurrently.

occasional success to problems outside of its guaranteed matrix
classes. Lemke's Algorithm is described in [Cottle 1992], Section 4.4.

The solver will denote failure on return if it exceeds a problem-size
dependent number of iterations.

Parameter ``M``:
    the LCP matrix.

Parameter ``q``:
    the LCP vector.

Parameter ``z``:
    the solution to the LCP on return (if the solver succeeds). If the
    length of z is equal to the length of q, the solver will attempt
    to use the basis from the last solution. This strategy can prove
    exceptionally fast if solutions differ little between successive
    calls. If the solver fails (returns ``False``), `z` will be set to
    the zero vector on return.

Parameter ``num_pivots``:
    the number of pivots used, on return.

Parameter ``zero_tol``:
    The tolerance for testing against zero. If the tolerance is
    negative (default) the solver will determine a generally
    reasonable tolerance.

Returns:
    ``True`` if the solver computes a solution to floating point
    tolerances (i.e., if IsSolution() returns ``True`` on the problem)
    and ``False`` otherwise.

Raises:
    RuntimeError if M is not square or the dimensions of M do not
    match the length of q.
