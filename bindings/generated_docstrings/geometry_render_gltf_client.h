R"""(Constructs a RenderEngine implementation which generates <a
href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html">glTF
</a> files to upload to a render server, and retrieves renderings from
said server by copying image data back into drake
systems::sensors::Image buffers. The server url and endpoint are
provided through the specified RenderEngineGltfClientParams. The
returned RenderEngine implements the client side of the
render_engine_gltf_client_server_api. The rules for supported
geometries and textures are the same as for the VTK-based engine and
are described in MakeRenderEngineVtk().

Note:
    The underlying RenderEngine utilizes [libcurl][libcurl] to
    communicate with a server. Static curl initialization must be
    performed once per process, and the operation is [**not**
    thread-safe][libcurl_threadsafe]! Instantiating this RenderEngine
    automatically initializes curl with the default
    [`curl_global_init(CURL_GLOBAL_ALL |
    CURL_GLOBAL_ACK_EINTR)`][libcurl_init], the implication for
    consuming applications being:

Note:
1. See allow_network "DRAKE_ALLOW_NETWORK" for an environment variable
option to deny remote rendering entirely.
2. If you intend to have your rendering take place in a threaded context,
you **must** instantiate this RenderEngine via MakeRenderEngineGltfClient
from the main thread **before** spawning your threaded workers.  As soon
as one of these RenderEngine instances has been constructed, libcurl will
have been initialized.

.. code-block:: c++

    // Setup your server information and create the RenderEngine.  This must
    // be done in a non-threaded context (e.g., at the program start).
    RenderEngineGltfClientParams params;
    params.base_url = "http://some-server.url";
    auto render_engine = MakeRenderEngineGltfClient(params);
    
    // After MakeRenderEngineGltfClient() function call, libcurl has been
    // initialized and you may now create threads if desired.

3. If you need to use a different initialization strategy for libcurl in your
application, you should first create the RenderEngine using
MakeRenderEngineGltfClient, then manually call
[`curl_global_cleanup()`][libcurl_cleanup], followed by manually calling
[`curl_global_init(...)`][libcurl_init] with your desired flags. In
general, this scenario is **atypical** and you should not need to worry
about this.  Applications with specialized libcurl needs, though, must
understand the construction and initialization order to be able to modify
the behavior to suit their needs.

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    // Follow the steps above to construct the RenderEngine given the
    // specified RenderEngineGltfClientParams.
    
    // Libcurl has been initialized at this point, so your application needs
    // to reset and re-initialize curl again.
    curl_global_cleanup();
    curl_global_init(...);  // <<< your custom flags here
    
    // Now that libcurl has been re-initialized to suit your application's
    // needs, you may now create threads if desired.
