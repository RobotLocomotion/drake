R"""(_Articulated Body Inertia_ is the inertia that a body appears to have
when it is the base (or root) of a rigid-body system, also referred to
as *Articulated Body* in the context of articulated body algorithms.
The *Articulated Body Inertia* is a very useful multibody dynamics
concept that was introduced by Featherstone [Featherstone 1983] to
develop the remarkable ``O(n)`` Articulated Body Algorithm (ABA) for
solving forward dynamics. Recall that the Newton-Euler equations allow
us to describe the combined rotational and translational dynamics of a
rigid body:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    F_BBo_W = M_B_W * A_WB + Fb_Bo_W                                     (1)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where the spatial inertia (see SpatialInertia) ``M_B_W`` of body B
expressed in the world frame W linearly relates the spatial
acceleration (see SpatialAcceleration) of body B in the world frame
with the total applied spatial forces (see SpatialForce) ``F_BBo`` on
body B and where ``Fb_Bo_W`` contains the velocity dependent
gyroscopic terms.

A similar relationship is found for an articulated body with a rigid
body B at the base (or root). Even though the bodies in this multibody
system are allowed to have relative motions among them, there still is
a linear relationship between the spatial force ``F_BBo_W`` applied on
this body and the resulting acceleration ``A_WB``:


.. raw:: html

    <details><summary>Click to expand C++ code...</summary>

.. code-block:: c++

    F_BBo_W = P_B_W * A_WB + Z_Bo_W                                       (2)

.. raw:: html

    </details>

where ``P_B_W`` is the articulated body inertia of body B and
``Z_Bo_W`` is a bias force that includes the gyroscopic and Coriolis
forces and becomes zero when all body velocities and all applied
generalized forces outboard from body B are zero [Jain 2010, §7.2.1].
The articulated body inertia ``P_B_W`` is related to the multibody
subsystem consisting only of bodies that are outboard of body B. We
refer to this subsystem as the *articulated body subsystem* associated
with body B. Equation (2) describes the acceleration response of body
B, but also taking into account all outboard bodies connected to B. A
special case is that of an articulated body composed of a single rigid
body. For this special case, Eq. (2) reduces to Eq. (1) for the
dynamics of rigid body B. In other words, the ABI for an articulated
body consisting of a single rigid body exactly equals the spatial
inertia of that body.

Articulated body inertias are elements of ℝ⁶ˣ⁶ that, as for spatial
inertias, are symmetric and positive semi-definite. However, ABI
objects **are not** spatial inertias. The spatial inertia of a rigid
body can be described by a reduced set of ten parameters, namely the
mass, center of mass and the six components of the rotational inertia
for that body. However, this parametrization by ten parameters is just
not possible for an ABI and the full 21 elements of the symmetric
``6x6`` matrix must be specified [Jain 2010, §6.4]. As a result ABI
objects can have different properties than spatial inertia objects. As
an example, the apparent mass of an articulated body will in general
depend on the direction of the applied force. That is, the simple
relationship ``F = m * a`` is no longer valid for an articulated
body's center of mass (refer to the excellent example 7.1 in
[Featherstone 2008]).

We adopt the notation introduced by [Jain 2010] and generally we will
use an uppercase P to represent an ABI. Thus, in typeset material we
use the symbol :math:`[P^{A/Q}]_E` to represent the spatial inertia of
an articulated body A, about a point Q, expressed in a frame E. For
this inertia, the monogram notation reads ``P_AQ_E``.

Note:
    This class does not implement any mechanism to track the frame E
    in which an articulated body inertia is expressed or about what
    point is computed. Methods and operators on this class have no
    means to determine frame consistency through operations. It is
    therefore the responsibility of users of this class to keep track
    of frames in which operations are performed. We suggest doing that
    using disciplined notation, as described above.

subject to any constraint (e.g. frictional contact constraint or fixed
constraint); it does not move under the influence of external forces
(e.g. gravity); and it does not necessarily satisfy the prescribed
boundary condition (if any). On the flip side, a disabled deformable
body does not affect the dynamics of other bodies, even if the
collision between the disabled body's geometry and other geometries is
not filtered. Effectively, the physics of the deformable body stop
being computed. The deformable body can be enabled by calling
Enable(). Calling Disable() on a body which is already disabled has no
effect.

R"""(This ForceElement models a revolute DoorHinge joint that could exhibit
different force/torque characteristics at different states due to the
existence of different type of torques on the joint. This class
implements a "christmas tree" accumulation of these different torques
in an empirical and unprincipled way. Specifically, different curves
are assigned to different torques to mimic their evolution based on
the joint state and some prespecified parameters.

Torques considered in this implementation include: * torsional spring
torque (τ_ts) -- position dependent * catch torque (τ_c) -- position
dependent * dynamic friction torque (τ_df) -- velocity dependent *
static friction torque (τ_sf) -- velocity dependent * viscous friction
torque (τ_vf) -- velocity dependent

We then implement two curves to approximate the progression of
different torques. A curve ``s(t, x) = tanh(x/t)`` uses the ``tanh``
function to approximate a step curve ({`x<0`: -1 ; ``x>0``: 1})
outside of ``-t < x < t``. The curve ``doublet(t, x) = 2 * s * (1 −
s²)`` is the second derivative of ``s`` scaled by ``-t²``, which
yields a lump at negative ``x`` that integrates to -1 and a lump at
positive ``x`` that integrates to 1. Finally, the total external
torque on the hinge joint would be:

``τ = τ_ts + τ_c + τ_df + τ_sf + τ_vf``.

where ``τ_ts = -k_ts * (q − qs₀)``, `τ_c = k_c * doublet(qc₀/2, q −
qc₀/2)``, `τ_df = -k_df * s(k_q̇₀, q̇)``, `τ_sf = -k_sf *
doublet(k_q̇₀, q̇)` and ``τ_vf = -k_vf * q̇``. The door is assumed to
be closed at ``q=0``, opening in the positive-q direction. Note that,
the sign of the torques depends on two elements: one is the sign of
the torque related constants and another one is the sign of the
assigned curves. For example, as defined above, the static friction
torque ``τ_sf`` should be opposite to the direction of the velocity
q̇. The catch torque ``τ_c`` should be negative when ``q < qc₀/2`` and
positive otherwise. This class applies all hinge-originating forces,
so it can be used instead of the SDF viscous damping. The users could
change the values of these different elements to obtain different
characteristics for the DoorHinge joint that the users want to model.
A jupyter notebook tool is also provided to help the users visualize
the curves and design parameters. Run ``bazel run
//bindings/pydrake/multibody:examples/door_hinge_inspector`` to bring
up the notebook.

**To give an example**, a common dishwasher door has a frictional
torque sufficient for it to rest motionless at any angle, a catch at
the top to hold it in place, a dashpot (viscous friction source) to
prevent it from swinging too fast, and a spring to counteract some of
its mass. Two figures are provided to illustrate the dishwasher
DoorHinge torque with the given default parameters. Figure 1 shows the
static characteristic of the dishwasher door. At q = 0, there exists a
negative catch torque to prevent the door from moving. After that, the
torsional spring torque will dominate to compensate part of the door
gravity. Figure 2 shows the dynamic feature of the dishwasher door at
q = 30 deg. It shows the door can be closed easily since the torque is
small when the velocity is negative. However, whenever the door
intends to open further, there will be a counter torque to prevent
that movement, which therefore keeps the door at rest. Note that, due
to the gravity, the dishwasher door will be fully open eventually.
This process can be really slow because of the default
``motion_threshold`` is set to be very small. You can change the
``motion_threshold`` parameter to adjust the time. @image html

In Drake we define a frame F rigidly attached to the parent body P
with pose ``X_PF`` and a frame M rigidly attached to the child body B
with pose ``X_BM``. A Joint object specifies a kinematic relation
between frames F and M, which in turn imposes a kinematic relation
between bodies P and B.

Typical joints include the ball joint, to allow unrestricted rotations
about a given point, the revolute joint, that constraints two bodies
to rotate about a given common axis, etc.

Consider the following example to build a simple pendulum system:

    MultibodyPlant<double> plant(0.0);
    // ... Code here to setup quantities below as mass, com, etc. ...
    const RigidBody<double>& pendulum =
      plant.AddRigidBody(SpatialInertia<double>(mass, com, unit_inertia));
    // We will connect the pendulum body to the world using a RevoluteJoint.
    // In this simple case the parent body P is the model's world body and frame
    // F IS the world frame.
    // Additionally, we need to specify the pose of frame M on the pendulum's
    // body frame B.
    // Say we declared and initialized X_BM...
    const RevoluteJoint<double>& elbow =
      plant.AddJoint<RevoluteJoint>(

Warning:
    Do not ever attempt to instantiate and manipulate Joint objects on
    the stack; it will fail. Add joints to your plant using the
    provided API MultibodyPlant::AddJoint() as in the example above.

Note:
    To developers: this is the base class for all concrete Joint
    types. Extending this class to add a new Joint type necessarily
    requires working with internal implementation classes for which we
    cannot guarantee API stability due to the need for ongoing
    improvements to these performance-critical classes. So while our
    usual stability guarantees apply to the Joint ``public`` API, the
    ``protected`` API here is subject to change when the underlying
    internal objects change. Our release notes will say when we have
    made changes that might affect your Joint implementations, but we
    won't necessarily be able to provide a deprecation period.)""";

R"""(This ForceElement models a massless flexible bushing that connects a
frame A of a link (body) L0 to a frame C of a link (body) L1. The
bushing can apply a torque and force due to stiffness (spring) and
dissipation (damper) properties. Frame B is the bushing frame whose
origin Bo is halfway between Ao (A's origin) and Co (C's origin) and
whose unit vectors 𝐁𝐱, 𝐁𝐲, 𝐁𝐳 are "halfway" (in an angle-axis sense)
between the unit vectors of frame A and frame C. Frame B is a
"floating" frame in the sense that it is calculated from the position
and orientation of frames A and C (B is not welded to the bushing).

width=80%

The set of forces on frame C from the bushing is equivalent to a
torque 𝐭 on frame C and a force 𝐟 applied to a point Cp of C. The set
of forces on frame A from the bushing is equivalent to a torque −𝐭 on
frame A and a force −𝐟 applied to a point Ap of A. Points Ap and Cp
are coincident with Bo (frame B's origin).

This "quasi-symmetric" bushing force/torque model was developed at
Toyota Research Institute and has advantages compared to traditional
bushing models because it employs a bushing-centered "symmetric" frame
B and it ensures the moment of −𝐟 on A about Ao is equal to the moment
of 𝐟 on C about Co. Traditional models differ as they lack a
"symmetric" frame B and apply −𝐟 at Ao, which means the moment of −𝐟
on A about Ao is always zero. Note: This bushing model is not fully
symmetric since the orientation between frames A and C is
parameterized with roll-pitch-yaw angles [q₀ q₁ q₂]. Since these
angles have an inherent sequence, they are not mathematically
symmetric.

The torque model depends on spring-damper "gimbal" torques ``τ ≜ [τ₀
τ₁ τ₂]`` which themselves depend on roll-pitch-yaw angles ``q ≜ [q₀ q₁
q₂]`` and rates ``q̇ = [q̇₀ q̇₁ q̇₂]`` via a diagonal torque-stiffness
matrix K₀₁₂ and a diagonal torque-damping matrix D₀₁₂ as

    τ does not represent a vector expressed in one frame. Instead it
    is regarded as a 3x1 array of torque scalars associated with
    roll-pitch yaw.

Note:
    As discussed in the Advanced section below, τ is not 𝐭 ``(τ ≠
    𝐭)``.

Note:
    This is a "linear" bushing model as gimbal torque τ varies
    linearly with q and q̇ as τ = τᴋ + τᴅ where τᴋ = −K₀₁₂ ⋅ q and τᴅ
    = −D₀₁₂ ⋅ q̇.

The bushing model for the net force 𝐟 on frame C from the bushing
depends on scalars x, y, z which are defined so 𝐫 (the position vector
from Ao to Co) can be expressed in frame B as ``𝐫 ≜ p_AoCo = [x y z]ʙ
= x 𝐁𝐱 + y 𝐁𝐲 + z 𝐁𝐳``. The model for 𝐟 uses a diagonal
force-stiffness matrix Kxyᴢ, a diagonal force-damping matrix Dxyᴢ, and
defines fx, fy, fz so ``𝐟 = [fx fy fz]ʙ``.

constants and must have non-negative values.

    with 𝐫 and 𝐫̇̇ as 𝐟 = 𝐟ᴋ + 𝐟ᴅ where 𝐟ᴋ = −Kxyz ⋅ 𝐫 and 𝐟ᴅ = −Dxyz

This bushing's constructor sets the torque stiffness/damping constants
``[k₀ k₁ k₂]`` and ``[d₀ d₁ d₂]`` and the force stiffness/damping
constants ``[kx ky kz]`` and ``[dx dy dz]``. The examples below
demonstrate how to model various joints that have a flexible (e.g.,
rubber) mount. The damping values below with ? may be set to 0 or a
reasonable positive number.

Bushing type | torque constants | force constants
--------------------------------|:--------------------|:------------------
z-axis revolute joint | k₀₁₂ = ``[k₀ k₁ 0]`` | kxyz = ``[kx ky kz]`` ^
| d₀₁₂ = ``[d₀ d₁ ?]`` | dxyz = ``[dx dy dz]`` x-axis prismatic joint
| k₀₁₂ = ``[k₀ k₁ k₂]`` | kxyz = ``[0 ky kz]`` ^ | d₀₁₂ = ``[d₀ d₁

^ | d₀₁₂ = ``[d₀ d₁ d₂]`` | dxyz = ``[dx dy dz]``

Angles q₀, q₁, q₂ are calculated from frame C's orientation relative
to frame A, with ``[−π < q₀ ≤ π, −π/2 ≤ q₁ ≤ π/2, −π < q₂ ≤ π]``,
hence, there is no angle wrapping and torque stiffness has a limited
range. Gimbal torques τ can be discontinuous if one of q₀, q₁, q₂ is
discontinuous and its associated torque spring constant is nonzero.
For example, τ₂ is discontinuous if ``k₂ ≠ 0`` and the bushing has a
large rotation so q₂ jumps from ``≈ −π to π``. τ can also be
discontinuous if one of q̇₀, q̇₁, q̇₂ is discontinuous and its
associated torque damper constant is nonzero. For example, τ₀ is
discontinuous if ``d₀ ≠ 0`` and q̇₀ is undefined (which occurs when
``pitch = q₁ = π/2``). Note: Due to the relationship of 𝐭 to τ shown
below, 𝐭 is discontinuous if τ is discontinuous.

As shown below, there are multiple ways to estimate torque and force
stiffness and damping constants. Use a method or combination of
methods appropriate for your application. For example, some methods
are more useful for a real physical bushing whereas other methods
(called "penalty methods") can be more useful when replacing an ideal
joint (such as a revolute or fixed/weld joint) with a bushing.

Consider a penalty method if you want a bushing to substitute for a
"hard" constraint (e.g., an ideal joint). Since a bushing is
inherently compliant it will violate a hard constraint somewhat. The
stiffer the bushing, the more accurately it enforces the hard
constraint, but at a cost of more computational time. To balance
accuracy versus time, consider your tolerance for constraint errors.
For example, is it OK for your bushing to displace xₘₐₓ = 1 mm for an
estimated Fxₘₐₓ = 100 N? Also, one way to choose a force damping
constant dx is by choosing a "reasonably small" settling time tₛ,
where settling time tₛ is the interval of time for a system to settle
to within 1% (0.01) of an equilibrium solution). Is tₛ = 0.01 s
negligible for a robot arm with a 10 s reach maneuver?

**** How to choose a torque stiffness constant k₀ or damping constant
d₀. The estimate of stiffness k₀ depends on whether you are modeling a
physical bushing (consider stiffness methods 1 or 2 below) or whether
you are using a bushing to replace an ideal joint such as a revolute
or fixed/weld joint (consider stiffness "penalty methods" 3 or 4
below). 1. Use a static experiment, e.g., apply a known moment load
Mx, measure the associated angular displacement Δq (radians), and
estimate k₀ = Mx / Δq. 2. Use FEA (finite element analysis) software
to estimate k₀. 3. Pick a desired maximum angular displacement qₘₐₓ,
estimate a maximum moment load Mxₘₐₓ, and estimate ``k₀ = Mxₘₐₓ /
qₘₐₓ`` (units of N*m/rad). 4. Choose a characteristic moment of
inertia I₀ (directionally dependent), choose a desired angular
frequency ωₙ > 0 (in rad/s) and estimate ``k₀ = I₀ ωₙ²`` (units of
N*m/rad).

The estimate of damping d₀ depends on whether you are modeling a
physical bushing (consider damping method 1 below) or whether you are
using a bushing to enforce a constraint (consider damping methods 2 or
3 below). 1. Use experiments to estimate a damping ratio ζ and
settling time tₛ. Compute "undamped natural frequency" ωₙ from ζ and
tₛ (as shown below in the Advanced section), then ``d₀ = 2 ζ k₀ / ωₙ``
(units of N*m*s/rad). 2. Choose a damping ratio ζ (e.g., ζ = 1,
critical damping) and a desired settling time tₛ, calculate ωₙ (as
shown below in the Advanced section), then ``d₀ = 2 ζ k₀ / ωₙ`` (units
of N*m*s/rad). 3. Choose a damping ratio ζ (e.g., ζ = 1, critical
damping), estimate a characteristic moment of inertia and calculate
``d₀ = 2 ζ √(I₀ k₀)``.

Refer to Advanced_bushing_stiffness_and_damping "Advanced bushing
stiffness and damping" for more details.

**** How to choose a force stiffness constant kx or damping constant
dx. The estimate of stiffness kx depends on whether you are modeling a
real bushing (consider stiffness methods 1 or 2 below) or whether you
are using a bushing to replace an ideal joint such as a revolute or
fixed/weld joint (consider stiffness "penalty methods" 3 or 4 below).
1. Use a static experiment, e.g., apply a known force load Fx, measure
the associated displacement (stretch) Δx (in meters), and estimate kx
= Fx / Δx. 2. Use FEA (finite element analysis) software to estimate
kx (units of N/m). 3. Pick a desired maximum displacement xₘₐₓ,
estimate a maximum force load Fxₘₐₓ, and estimate ``kx = Fxₘₐₓ /
xₘₐₓ`` (units of N/m). 4. Choose a characteristic mass m (which may be
directionally dependent), choose a desired angular frequency ωₙ > 0
(in rad/s) and estimate ``kx = m ωₙ²`` (units of N/m).

The estimate of damping dx depends on whether you are modeling a
physical bushing (consider damping method 1 below) or whether you are
using a bushing to enforce a constraint (consider damping methods 2 or
3 below). 1. Use experiments to estimate a damping ratio ζ and
settling time tₛ. Compute "undamped natural frequency" ωₙ from ζ and
tₛ (as shown below in the Advanced section), then ``dx = 2 ζ kx / ωₙ``
(units of N*s/m). 2. Choose a damping ratio ζ (e.g., ζ = 1, critical
damping) and a desired settling time tₛ, calculate ωₙ (as shown below
in the Advanced section), then ``dx = 2 ζ kx / ωₙ`` (units of N*s/m).
3. Choose a damping ratio ζ (e.g., ζ = 1, critical damping), estimate
a characteristic mass m and calculate ``dx = 2 ζ √(m kx)`` (units of
N*s/m).

Refer to Advanced_bushing_stiffness_and_damping "Advanced bushing
stiffness and damping" for more details.

**** Advanced: Relationship of 𝐭 to τ. To understand how "gimbal
torques" τ relate to 𝐭, it helps to remember that the RollPitchYaw
class documentation states that a Space-fixed (extrinsic) X-Y-Z
rotation with roll-pitch-yaw angles [q₀ q₁ q₂] is equivalent to a
Body-fixed (intrinsic) Z-Y-X rotation by yaw-pitch-roll angles [q₂ q₁
q₀]. In the context of "gimbal torques", the Body-fixed Z-Y-X rotation
sequence with angles [q₂ q₁ q₀] is physical meaningful as it produces
torques associated with successive frames in a gimbal as τ₂ 𝐀𝐳, τ₁ 𝐏𝐲,
τ₀ 𝐂𝐱, where each of 𝐀𝐳, 𝐏𝐲, 𝐂𝐱 are unit vectors associated with a
frame in the yaw-pitch-roll rotation sequence and 𝐏𝐲 is a unit vector
of the "pitch" intermediate frame. As described earlier, torque 𝐭 is
the moment of the bushing forces on frame C about Cp. Scalars tx, ty,
tz are defined so 𝐭 can be expressed ``𝐭 = [tx ty tz]ᴀ = tx 𝐀𝐱 + ty 𝐀𝐲
+ tz 𝐀𝐳``. As shown in code documentation, the relationship of [tx ty
tz] to [τ₀ τ₁ τ₂] was found by equating 𝐭's power to τ's power as 𝐭 ⋅
w_AC = τ ⋅ q̇.

**** Advanced: More on how to choose bushing stiffness and damping
constants. The basics on how to choose bushing stiffness and damping
constants are at: - Basic_bushing_torque_stiffness_and_damping "How to
choose torque stiffness and damping constants" -
Basic_bushing_force_stiffness_and_damping "How to choose force
stiffness and damping constants"

The list below provides more detail on: The performance tradeoff
between high stiffness and long simulation time; loads that affect
estimates of Mxₘₐₓ or Fxₘₐₓ; and how a linear 2ⁿᵈ-order ODE provides
insight on how to experimentally determine stiffness and damping
constants. - Stiffness [k₀ k₁ k₂] and [kx ky kz] affect simulation
time and accuracy. Generally, a stiffer bushing better resembles an
ideal joint (e.g., a revolute joint or fixed/weld joint). However
(depending on integrator), a stiffer bushing usually increases
numerical integration time. - An estimate for a maximum load Mxₘₐₓ or
Fxₘₐₓ accounts for gravity forces, applied forces, inertia forces
(centripetal, Coriolis, gyroscopic), etc. - One way to determine
physical stiffness and damping constants is through the mathematical
intermediaries ωₙ (units of rad/s) and ζ (no units). The constant ωₙ
(called "undamped natural frequency" or "angular frequency") and
constant ζ (called "damping ratio") relate to the physical constants
mass m, damping constant dx, and stiffness constant kx via the
following prototypical linear constant-coefficient 2ⁿᵈ-order ODEs.

One way to determine ωₙ is from settling time tₛ which approximates
the time for a system to settle to within a specified settling ratio
of an equilibrium solutions. Typical values for settling ratio are 1%
(0.01), 2% (0.02), 5% (0.05), and 10% (0.10). - When ζ < 0.7
(underdamped), a commonly used approximation is ωₙ ≈
-ln(settling_ratio) / (ζ tₛ) which for settling ratios 0.01 and 0.05
give ωₙ ≈ 4.6 / (ζ tₛ) and ωₙ ≈ 3 / (ζ tₛ). Another commonly used
approximation is ωₙ ≈ -ln(settling_ratio √(1- ζ²)) / (ζ tₛ). See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settling_time or the book Modern Control
Engineering by Katsuhiko Ogata. Although these approximate formulas
for ωₙ are common, they are somewhat inaccurate. Settling time for
underdamped systems is discontinuous and requires solving a nonlinear
algebraic equation (an iterative process). For more information, see
http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rfiua/n66/n66a09.pdf [Ramos-Paja, et. al
2012], "Accurate calculation of settling time in second order systems:
a photovoltaic application". Another reference is
https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece486/sp2020/laboratory/docs/lab2/estimates.html
- When ζ ≈ 1 (critically damped), ωₙ is determined by choosing a
settling ratio and then solving for (ωₙ tₛ) via the nonlinear
algebraic equation (1 + ωₙ tₛ)*exp(-ωₙ tₛ) = settling_ratio. Settling
ratio | ωₙ -------------- | ------------- 0.01 | 6.64 / tₛ 0.02 | 5.83
/ tₛ 0.05 | 4.74 / tₛ 0.10 | 3.89 / tₛ See
https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/296567/over-and-critically-damped-systems-settling-time
- When ζ ≥ 1.01 (overdamped), ωₙ ≈ -ln(2 settling_ratio sz/s₂) / (s₁
tₛ) where sz = √(ζ² - 1), s₁ = ζ - sz, s₂ = ζ + sz. The derivation and
approximation error estimates for this overdamped settling time
formula is ApproximateOverdampedSettlingTime "below".

- For a real physical bushing, an experiment is one way to estimate damping
constants.  For example, to estimate a torque damping constant d₀ associated
with underdamped vibrations (damping ratio 0 < ζ < 1), attach the bushing to
a massive rod, initially displace the rod by angle Δq, release the rod and
measure q(t).  From the q(t) measurement, estimate decay ratio (the ratio of
successive peak heights above the final steady-state value) calculate
logarithmic decrement δ = -ln(decay_ratio), calculate damping ratio
ζ = √(δ² / (4π² + δ²)), then calculate d₀ using d₀ = 2 ζ √(I₀ k₀) or
d₀ = 2 ζ k₀ / ωₙ. For more information, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_ratio#Logarithmic_decrement

**** Derivation: Approximate formula for overdamped settling time.
Since a literature reference for this formula was not found, the
derivation below was done at TRI (it has not been peer reviewed). This
formula results from the "dominant pole" solution in the prototypical
constant-coefficient linear 2ⁿᵈ-order ODE. For ẋ(0) = 0, mathematics
shows poles p₁ = -ωₙ s₁, p₂ = -ωₙ s₂, where sz = √(ζ² - 1), s₁ = ζ -
sz, s₂ = ζ + sz. and

.. code-block:: c++

    x(t) / x(0) = p₂/(p₂-p₁) exp(p₁ t) - p₁/(p₂-p₁) exp(p₂ t)
                 = s₂/(s₂-s₁) exp(p₁ t) - s₁/(s₂-s₁) exp(p₂ t)
                 =  k/( k-1 ) exp(p₁ t) -  1/( k-1 ) exp(p₂ t) where k = s₂ / s₁
                 ≈  k/( k-1 ) exp(p₁ t)                        since p₁ > p₂

.. raw:: html

    </details>

Note: k = s₂ / s₁ is real, k > 0, s₂ = k s₁, and p₁ > p₂ (p₁ is less
negative then p₂), so exp(p₁ t) decays to zero slower than exp(p₂ t)
and exp(p₁ t) ≫ exp(p₂ t) for sufficiently large t. Hence we assume
exp(p₂ t) ≈ 0 (which is why p₁ is called the "dominant pole"). Next,

.. code-block:: c++

    k/(k - 1) = s₂ / s₁ / (s₂/s₁ -1) = s₂ / (s₂ - s₁) = s₂ / (2 sz),  so
      x(t) / x(0)  ≈  s₂ / (2 sz) exp(-s₁ ωₙ t),                        hence
      settling_ratio ≈ s₂ / (2 sz) exp(-s₁ ωₙ tₛ),                      finally
      ωₙ ≈ -ln(settling_ratio 2 sz / s₂) / (s₁ tₛ)

The table below shows that there is little error in this approximate
formula for various settling ratios and ζ, particularly for ζ ≥ 1.1.
For 1.0 ≤ ζ < 1.1, the critical damping estimates of ωₙ work well.

mechanics [Goldstein 2001]. It can be demonstrated that the
unconstrained three-dimensional motions of a rigid body can be
described by six coordinates and thus it is often said that a free
body in space has six **degrees of freedom**. These degrees of freedom
obey the Newton-Euler equations of motion. However, within a
MultibodyTree, a RigidBody is *not* free in space; instead, it is
assigned a limited number of degrees of freedom (0-6) with respect to
its parent body in the multibody tree by its Mobilizer (also called a
"tree joint" or "inboard joint"). Additional constraints on
permissible motion can be added using Constraint objects to remove
more degrees of freedom.

it frequently is.

makes sense without the other. Therefore, a RigidBodyFrame instance is
constructed in conjunction with its RigidBody and cannot be
constructed anywhere else. However, you can still access the frame

body or composite body about a particular point. Herein, "composite
body" means one body or a collection of bodies that are welded
together. In this documentation, "body" and "composite body" are used
interchangeably.

A **rigid** body's mass distribution is described by three quantities:
the body's mass; the body's center of mass; and the body's rotational
inertia about a particular point. The term **rotational inertia** is
used here and by [Jain 2010] to distinguish from a body's **spatial
inertia**. In this class, a 3x3 **inertia matrix** I represents a
body's rotational inertia about a point and expressed in a frame. More
specifically, ``I_BP_E`` is the inertia matrix of a body B about-point
P and expressed-in frame E (herein frame E's orthogonal unit vectors
Ex, Ey, Ez are denoted 𝐱̂, 𝐲̂, 𝐳̂).

The moments of inertia Ixx, Iyy, Izz and products of inertia Ixy, Ixz,
Iyz are defined in terms of the mass dm of a differential volume of
the body. The position of dm from about-point P is xx̂ + yŷ + zẑ =
[x, y, z]_E.

We use the negated convention for products of inertia, so that I
serves to relate angular velocity ω and angular momentum h via ``h = I
⋅ ω``. Ensure your products of inertia follow this negative sign
convention.

The 3x3 inertia matrix is symmetric and its diagonal elements (moments
of inertia) and off-diagonal elements (products of inertia) are
associated with a body (or composite body) S, an about-point P, and an
expressed-in frame E (𝐱̂, 𝐲̂, 𝐳̂̂). A rotational inertia is
ill-defined unless there is a body S, about-point P, and expressed-in
frame E. The user of this class is responsible for tracking the body
S, about-point P and expressed-in frame E (none of these are stored in
this class).

Note:
    This class does not store the about-point nor the expressed-in
    frame, nor does this class help enforce consistency of the
    about-point or expressed-in frame. To help users of this class
    track the about-point and expressed-in frame, we strongly
    recommend the following notation.

Note:
    In typeset material, use the symbol :math:`[I^{S/P}]_E` to
    represent the rotational inertia (inertia matrix) of a body (or
    composite body) S about-point P, expressed in frame E. In code and
    comments, use the monogram notation ``I_SP_E`` (e.g., as described
    in multibody_spatial_inertia). If the about-point P is fixed to a
    body B, the point is named :math:`B_P` and this appears in
    code/comments as ``Bp``. Examples: ``I_BBp_E`` is rigid body B's
    rotational inertia about-point Bp expressed-in frame E; I_BBo_E is
    B's rotational inertia about-point ``Bo`` (body B's origin)
    expressed-in frame E; and I_BBcm_E is B's inertia matrix
    about-point ``Bcm`` (B's center of mass) expressed-in frame E.

Note:
    The rotational inertia (inertia matrix) can be re-expressed in
    terms of a special frame whose orthogonal unit vectors are
    parallel to **principal axes of inertia** so that the inertia
    matrix is diagonalized with elements called **principal moments of
    inertia**.

Note:
    The formal definition of the inertia matrix :math:`I^{S/P}` of a
    system S about a point P follows the definition of the inertia
    dyadic 𝐈 of S about P, which begins by modeling S with n particles
    S₁ ... Sₙ (e.g., 12 grams of carbon can be modeled with n = 6.02 *
    10²³ molecules/particles). The inertia dyadic 𝐈₁ of one particle
    S₁ about point P is defined [Kane, 1985] in terms of m₁ (mass of
    S₁), ᴾ𝐩ˢ¹ (position vector from P to S₁), and the unit dyadic 𝐔
    which is defined by the property 𝐔 ⋅ 𝐯 = 𝐯 where 𝐯 is is any
    vector (this definition of 𝐔 is analogous to defining the identity
    matrix by the property 𝑰𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒕𝒚𝑴𝒂𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒙 * 𝒂𝒏𝒚𝑴𝒂𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒙 = 𝒂𝒏𝒚𝑴𝒂𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒙).

Note: The vector dot-product (⋅) above produces a scalar whereas the
vector multiply (*) produces a dyadic which is a 2nd-order tensor
(ᴾ𝐩ˢ¹ * ᴾ𝐩ˢ¹ is similar to the matrix outer-product of a 3x1 matrix
multiplied by a 1x3 matrix). An example inertia dyadic for a single
particle is shown further below. The inertia dyadic 𝐈 of the entire
system S is defined by summing the inertia dyadic of each particle Sᵢ
about P (i = 1, ... n), i.e.,

vectors.

The inertia dyadic 𝐈ᴮ of a rigid body B about Bcm (B's center of mass)
is related to various dynamic quantities. For example, B's angular
momentum 𝐇 about Bcm in a frame N and B's kinetic energy KE in N
relate to 𝐈ᴮ by

where 𝛚 is B's angular velocity in N, 𝐯 is Bcm's translational
velocity in N, and mᴮ is B's mass. When frame N happens to be a
Newtonian frame (also called an inertial frame or
non-rotating/non-accelerating frame), the moment 𝐓 of all forces on B
about Bcm relates to 𝐈ᴮ and 𝛂 (B's angular acceleration in N) by

Note:
    Several methods in this class throw a RuntimeError for invalid
    rotational inertia operations in debug releases only. This
    provides speed in a release build while facilitating debugging in
    debug builds. In addition, these validity tests are only performed
    for scalar types for which drake::scalar_predicate<T>::is_bool is
    ``True``. For instance, validity checks are not performed when T
    is symbolic::Expression.

    The methods of this class satisfy the "basic exception guarantee":

frame M attached to the child body B (see the Joint class's

freely with respect to F, introducing six degrees of freedom. However,
unlike the QuaternionFloatingJoint, the orientation of M relative to F
is parameterized with roll-pitch-yaw angles (see warning below). The
generalized coordinates q for this joint are the three orientation
angles followed by three generalized positions to describe the
translation of frame M's origin Mo in F with a position vector

q̇) and the linear velocity ``v_FM`` of frame M's origin Mo in frame

where, with the monogram notation described in
multibody_spatial_inertia, ``I_SP`` is the rotational inertia of body
or composite body S computed about a point P, m is the mass of this
composite body, ``p_PScm`` is the position vector from point P to the
center of mass ``Scm`` of the composite body S with ``p_PScm×``
denoting its skew-symmetric cross product matrix (defined such that
``a× b = a.cross(b)``), and ``Id`` is the identity matrix in ℝ³ˣ³. See
Section 2.1, p. 17 of [Jain 2010]. The logical arrangement as shown
above is chosen to be consistent with our logical arrangement for
spatial vectors as documented in multibody_spatial_algebra for which
the rotational component comes first followed by the translational
component.

In typeset material we use the symbol :math:`[M^{S/P}]_E` to represent
the spatial inertia of a body or composite body S about point P,
expressed in frame E. For this inertia, the monogram notation reads
``M_SP_E``. If the point P is fixed to a body B, we write that point
as :math:`B_P` which appears in code and comments as ``Bp``. So if the
body or composite body is B and the about point is ``Bp``, the
monogram notation reads ``M_BBp_E``, which can be abbreviated to
``M_Bp_E`` since the about point ``Bp`` also identifies the body.
Common cases are that the about point is the origin ``Bo`` of the
body, or it's the center of mass ``Bcm`` for which the rotational
inertia in monogram notation would read as ``I_Bo_E`` and ``I_Bcm_E``,
respectively. Given ``M_BP_E`` (:math:`[M^{B/P}]_E`), the rotational
inertia of this spatial inertia is ``I_BP_E`` (:math:`[I^{B/P}]_E`)
and the position vector of the center of mass measured from point P
and expressed in E is ``p_PBcm_E`` (:math:`[^Pp^{B_{cm}}]_E`).

Note:
    This class does not implement any mechanism to track the frame E
    in which a spatial inertia is expressed or about what point is
    computed. Methods and operators on this class have no means to
    determine frame consistency through operations. It is therefore
    the responsibility of users of this class to keep track of frames
    in which operations are performed. We suggest doing that using
    disciplined notation, as described above.

Note:
    Several methods in this class throw a RuntimeError for invalid
    rotational inertia operations in debug releases only. This
    provides speed in a release build while facilitating debugging in
    debug builds. In addition, these validity tests are only performed
    for scalar types for which drake::scalar_predicate<T>::is_bool is
    ``True``. For instance, validity checks are not performed when T
    is symbolic::Expression.

Note:
    The methods of this class satisfy the "basic exception guarantee":
    if an exception is thrown, the program will still be in a valid
    state. Specifically, no resources are leaked, and all objects'
    invariants are intact. Be aware that SpatialInertia objects may
    contain invalid inertia data in cases where input checking is
    skipped.

    The minimum possible length is equal to the space-diagonal of the

Note:
    Minimum possible length can be used to detect erroneous inertias
    associated with absurdly large objects or to detect errors when
    the minimum possible length is larger than the real physical
    geometry that underlies ``this`` spatial inertia (maybe due to
    inertia conversion errors, e.g., factor of 10⁷ from kg m² to g cm²
    or 10⁹ from kg m² to g mm²). To assess whether the minimum
    possible length is reasonable, it helps to have comparable sizes,
    e.g., the world's largest aircraft carrier has a space-diagonal ≈
    355 m (length ≈ 337 m, width ≈ 78 m, height ≈ 76 m), the largest
    land vehicle (Bagger bucket-wheel excavator) is ≈ 224 m long, the

    carry a 15.2 m Canadarm, the world's largest humanoid robot
    (Mononofu) is ≈ 8.5 m tall. Also, minimum possible length can be
    compared to known physical geometry (e.g., realistic collision
    geometry, visual geometry, or physical extents associated with
    body connectivity data and topology), and this comparison can be
    used to warn that a spatial inertia may be physically impossible

R"""(This class is used to represent rotational inertias for unit mass
bodies. Therefore, unlike RotationalInertia whose units are kg⋅m², the
units of a UnitInertia are those of length squared. A unit inertia is
a useful concept to represent the geometric distribution of mass in a
body regardless of the actual value of the body mass. The rotational
inertia of a body can therefore be obtained by multiplying its unit
inertia by its mass. Unit inertia matrices can also be called
**gyration** matrices and therefore we choose to represent them in
source code notation with the capital letter G. In contrast, the
capital letter I is used to represent non-unit mass rotational
inertias. This class restricts the set of allowed operations on a unit
inertia to ensure the unit-mass invariant. For instance,
multiplication by a scalar can only return a general RotationalInertia
but not a UnitInertia.

Note:
    This class has no means to check at construction from user
    provided parameters whether it actually represents the unit
    inertia or gyration matrix of a unit-mass body. However, as
    previously noted, once a unit inertia is created, a number of
    operations are disallowed to ensure the unit-mass invariant. Also
    notice that once a unit inertia is created, it *is* the unit
    inertia of *some* body, perhaps with scaled geometry from the
    user's intention.

Note:
    The methods of this class satisfy the "basic exception guarantee":
    if an exception is thrown, the program will still be in a valid
    state. Specifically, no resources are leaked, and all objects'
    invariants are intact. Be aware that UnitInertia objects may
    contain invalid inertia data in cases where input checking is
    skipped.

R"""(This joint models a universal joint allowing two bodies to rotate
relative to one another with two degrees of freedom. A universal joint
can be thought of as a mechanism consisting of three bodies; the
parent body P, an intermediate cross-shaped body I, and the child body
B. In a physical universal joint, body I has a significantly smaller
mass than P or B. This universal joint model corresponds to the
mathematical limit of having a body I of negligible mass. Given a
frame F attached to the parent body P and a frame M attached to the
child body B (see the Joint class's documentation), the orientation of
M in F can then naturally be defined as follows using a body fixed
rotation sequence. A first rotation of θ₁ about Fx defines the
orientation R_FI of the intermediate frame I attached to body I
(notice that by definition Ix = Fx at all times). A second rotation of
θ₂ about Iy defines the orientation R_IM of frame M (notice that by
definition My = Iy at all times). Mathematically, the orientation of
frame M in F is given by

No translational motion of M in F is allowed and the origins, ``Mo``
and ``Fo``, of frames M and F respectively remain coincident. The
angles of rotation about F's x-axis and M's y-axis, along with their
rates, specify the state of the joint. Zero θ₁, θ₂ angles corresponds
to frames F, I, and M being coincident. Angles (θ₁, θ₂) are defined to
be positive according to the right-hand-rule with the thumb aligned in
the direction of their respective axes.)""";
