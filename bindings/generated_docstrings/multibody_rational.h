R"""(For certain robots (whose joint transforms are algebraic functions of
joint variables, for example revolute/prismatic/floating-base joints),
we can represent the pose (position, orientation) of each body, as
rational functions, namely n(s) / d(s) where both the numerator n(s)
and denominator d(s) are polynomials of s, and s is some variable
related to the generalized position.

One example is that for a rotation matrix with angle θ and axis a, the
rotation matrix can be written as I + sinθ A + (1-cosθ) A², where A is
the skew-symmetric matrix from axis a. We can use the stereographic
projection to substitute the trigonometric function sinθ and cosθ as
cosθ = cos(θ*+Δθ) = cos(θ*)•cos(Δθ) - sin(θ*)•sin(Δθ) = (1-s²)/(1+s²)
cos(θ*)- 2s/(1+s²) sin(θ*) (1) sinθ = sin(θ*+Δθ) = sin(θ*)•cos(Δθ) -
cos(θ*)•sin(Δθ) = (1-s²)/(1+s²) sin(θ*)- 2s/(1+s²) cos(θ*) (2) where
θ* is the angle around which we take the stereographic projection. θ =
θ*+Δθ, and s = tan(Δθ/2). With (1) and (2), both sinθ and cosθ are
written as a rational function of s. Thus the rotation matrix can be
written as rational functions of s.

We will use q* to denote the nominal posture. For a revolute joint,
the q* is the variable θ*. Note that the stereographic projection has
a singularity at θ = θ* ± π, as s = tan(Δθ/2)=tan(±π/2) is ±infinity.

For prismatic joint, we define s = d - d*, where d is the displacement
of the joint, and d* is the joint value in q*.

Currently we only support robots with revolute, prismatic and weld
joints.

Throughout this file, we use the following convention 1. q denotes the
generalized position of the entire robot. It includes the angle of a
revolute joint, the displacement of a prismatic joint, etc. 2. θ
denotes the revolute joint angle. 3. t=tan((θ-θ*)/2) 4. s is the
vector of variables, such that the robot body pose is written as an
algebraic function (rational function) of s.)""";
