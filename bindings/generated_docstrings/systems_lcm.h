LcmInterfaceSystem within the given diagram builder for each bus, and
returns an LcmBuses object that provides access to the
drake::lcm::DrakeLcmInterface objects that were created.

Because the interfaces live within the builder (and so eventually, the
diagram), the diagram will pump the interfaces when it's used with a
simulator. Refer to the LcmInterfaceSystem documentation for details.

The interface pointers remain owned by the builder; the LcmBuses
object merely aliases into the builder (and then eventually, the
diagram).

As a special case, the user can opt-out of LCM either by passing
``nullopt`` as the drake::lcm::DrakeLcmParams, or by setting the URL
within the DrakeLcmParams to LcmBuses::kLcmUrlMemqNull. In that case,
only a drake::lcm::DrakeLcmInterface object will be created (not a
full LcmInterfaceSystem), and the LCM messages will *not* be pumped.
