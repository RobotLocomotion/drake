        messages are coming from multiple kinds of sources concurrently:
        from pure Python, from the Python main thread calling into pybind11'd
        C++ code, and from a C++ worker thread.

        Prior to the bugfix merged along with this test case, the code would
        segfault (when using the prior implementation), or deadlock and timeout
        (if the implementation still used spdlog mutexes). A successful test
        does not make any unittest assertions; the fact that is runs without
        faults is a sufficient proof of safety.
