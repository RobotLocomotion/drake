# Overview

Drake uses [pybind11](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for binding
its C++ API to Python.

At present, a fork of `pybind11` is used which permits bindings matrices with
`dtype=object`, passing `unique_ptr` objects, and prevents aliasing for Python
classes derived from `pybind11` classes.

## `pybind11` Tips

### Python Types

Throughout the Drake code, Python types provided by `pybind11` are used, such
as `py::handle`, `py::object`, `py::module`, `py::str`, `py::list`, etc.
For an overview, see the
[pybind11 reference](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html).

All of these are effectively thin wrappers around `PyObject*`, and thus can be
cheaply copied.

Mutating the referred-to object also does not require passing by reference, so
you can always pass the object by value for functions, but you should document
your method if it mutates the object in a non-obvious fashion.

### Python Type Conversions

You can implicit convert between `py::object` and its derived classes (such
as `py::list`, `py::class_`, etc.), assuming the actual Python types agree.
You may also implicitly convert from `py::object` (and its derived classes) to
`py::handle`.

If you wish to convert a `py::handle` (or `PyObject*`) to `py::object` or a
derived class, you should use
[`py::reinterpret_borrow<>`](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html#_CPPv218reinterpret_borrow6handle).

# Conventions

## Target Conventions

Target names should be of the following form:

- `*_py`: A Python library (can be pure Python or pybind)
  - File Names: `*.py`, `*_py.cc`

- `*_pybind`: A C++ library for adding pybind-specific utilities to be consumed
  by C++.
  - File Names: `*_pybind.{h,cc}`

File names should follow form with their respective target.

### Bazel

Given that `libdrake.so` relies on static linking for components,
any common headers should be robust against ODR violations. This can
be normally achieved by using header-only libraries.

For upstream dependencies of these libraries, do NOT depend on the direct
targets (e.g. `//common:essential`), because this will introduce runtime ODR
violations for objects that have static storage (UID counters, etc.).

Instead, you must temporarily violate IWYU because it will be satisfied by
`drake_pybind_library`, which will incorporate `libdrake.so` and the transitive
headers.

If singletons are required (e.g. for `util/cpp_param_pybind`), consider storing
the singleton values using Python.

If you are developing bindings for a small portion of Drake and would like to
avoid rebuilding a large number of components when testing, consider editing
`//tools/install/libdrake:build_components.bzl` to reduce the number of
components being built.

## pybind Module Definitions

- Any Drake pybind module should include this header file, `pydrake_pybind.h`.
- `PYBIND_MODULE` should be used to define modules.
- Modules should be defined within the namespace `drake::pydrake`.
- The alias `namespace py = pybind11` is defined as `drake::pydrake::py`. Drake
modules should not re-define this alias at global scope.
- If a certain namespace is being bound (e.g. `drake::systems::sensors`), you
may use `using namespace drake::systems::sensors` within functions or
anonymous namespaces. Avoid `using namespace` directives otherwise.

## Keep Alive Behavior

`py::keep_alive` is used heavily throughout this code. For more
information, please see [the pybind11 documentation](
http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/functions.html#keep-alive).

Terse notes are added to method bindings to indicate the patient
(object being kept alive by nurse) and the nurse (object keeping patient
alive). To expand on them:
- "Keep alive, ownership" implies that one argument is owned directly by
one of the other arguments (`self` is included in those arguments, for
`py::init<>` and class methods).
- "Keep alive, reference" implies a reference that is lifetime-sensitive
(something that is not necessarily owned by the other arguments).
- "Keep alive, transitive" implies a transfer of ownership of owned
objects from one container to another (e.g. transfering all `System`s
from `DiagramBuilder` to `Diagram` when calling
`DiagramBuilder.Build()`).

## Function Overloads

To bind function overloads, please try the following (in order):
- `py::overload_cast<Args>(func)`: See [the pybind11 documentation](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/classes.html#overloaded-methods).
This works about 80% of the time.
- `pydrake::overload_cast_explicit<Return, Args...>(func)`: When
`py::overload_cast` does not work (not always guaranteed to work).
- `static_cast`, as mentioned in the pybind11 documentation.
- Lambdas, e.g. `[](Args... args) -> auto&& { return func(args...); }`
(using perfect forwarding when appropriate).

# Interactive Debugging with Bazel

If you would like to interactively debug binding code (using IPython for
general Python behavior, or GDB for C++ behavior), debug C++ behavior from a
Python binary, while using Bazel, you may expose Bazel's development
environment variables by adding these lines to your Python script:

    import subprocess
    subprocess.Popen(
        "export -p | sed 's# PWD=# OLD_PWD=#g' | tee /tmp/env.sh",
        shell=True)

Run your target once from Bazel, and then source the generated `/tmp/env.sh` in
your terminal to gain access to the environment variables (e.g. `$PYTHONPATH`).

## Example with GDB

This is a brief recipe for debugging with GDB
(note the usage of subshell `(...)` to keep the variables scoped):

    (
        target=//bindings/pydrake/systems:lifetime_test
        target_bin=$(echo ${target} | sed -e 's#//##' -e 's#:#/#')
        bazel run -c dbg ${target}
        workspace=$(bazel info workspace)
        name=$(basename ${workspace})
        cd ${workspace}/bazel-${name}
        source /tmp/env.sh
        gdb --args python ${workspace}/bazel-bin/${target_bin}
    )

This allows you to use GDB from the terminal, while being able to inspect the
sources in Bazel's symlink forests.

If using CLion, consider using `gdbserver`.
