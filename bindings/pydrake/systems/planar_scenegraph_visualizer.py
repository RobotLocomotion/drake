class PlanarSceneGraphVisualizer(PyPlotVisualizer):
    """
    Given a SceneGraph and a view plane, provides a view of the robot by
    projecting all geometry onto the view plane.

    This is intended to be used for robots that operate in the plane, but
    should render any robot approximately correctly. It has the following
    caveats:
    - z-ordering of objects is done based on the object centroid, which
    is not perfect for non-planar scenes.
    - Object geometry is projected onto the view plane, then a chull is taken,
    and finally that chull is drawn as a patch. Nonconvex geometry will thus be
    drawn incorrectly, and geometry with many vertices will slow down the
    visualizer.

    Specifics on view setup:

    T_VW specifies the 3x4 view projection matrix. For planar orthographic
    projection, use:
    [ <x axis select> x_axis_shift
      <y axis select> y_axis_shift
       0, 0, 0, 1]  % homogenizer

    e.g.

    [ 1 0 0 0.5
      0 1 0 0
      0 0 0 1].

    would give a top-down view (i.e squashing the z axis), and would shift
    things in the x axis positively by 0.5.

    T_VW can be any valid view projection matrix. If the bottom row is
    [0, 0, 0, 1], the view projection will be an orthographic projection.

    xlim and ylim don't technically provide extra functionality, but it's
    easier to keep handling scaling with xlim, ylim, and view plane selection
    and *maybe* offsetting with the projection matrix.
