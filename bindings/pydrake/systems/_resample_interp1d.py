def _resample_interp1d(t, x, timestep):
    """
    A linear interpolation only version of scipy.interpolate.interp1d.

    Args:
        t : (N,) array_like
            A 1-D array of real values.
        x : (...,N,...) array_like
            A N-D array of real values. The length of `y` along the
            interpolation axis must be equal to the length of `x`.
        timestep: The simulation timestep, used to resample t
            evenly between min(t) and the last time with a distance of timestep
            between each unit.

    Note:
        In order to correctly interpolate values, the time sequence described
        by ``t`` must be sorted in increasing order.  In the
        rare event that the ``t`` are **not** sorted, the returned values
        **will** be sorted.  Both ``t`` and ``x`` are
        copied and sorted first, then resampled and interpolated.

    Returns:
        (t, x): The newly sampled (times, data) for plotting, their dimensions
            will be the same along the corresponding axes (rows of t and cols
            of x are equivalent).
