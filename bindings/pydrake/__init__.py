# When importing `pydrake` as an external under Bazel, Bazel will use a shared
# library whose relative RPATHs are incorrect for `libdrake.so`, and thus will
# fail to load; this issue is captured in bazelbuild/bazel#4594. As a
# workaround, we can use a library that properly links to `libdrake.so`, but in
# `{runfiles}/{workspace}/external/drake` rather than `{runfiles}/drake`.
# Once this is loaded, all of the Python C-extension libraries
# that depend on it (and its dependencies) will load properly.
# Please note that this workaround is only important when running under the
# Bazel runfiles tree. Installed `pydrake` should not have this issue.
# N.B. We do not import `external.drake.bindings.pydrake` as this may cause
# duplicate classes to be loaded (#8810). This will not be a problem once #7912
# is resolved.
