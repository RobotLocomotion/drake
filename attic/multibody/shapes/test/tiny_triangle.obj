# This OBJ file contains a face that needs to be triangulated, but one of the
# triangles formed is microscopically small.  This represents a failure
# condition in the triangulation.
#
# The fan is formed from vertex 1.  Edges (1, 2) and (2, 3) have length 1e-10.
# The resultant triangle (1, 2, 3) will have an area that falls below the
# required threshold of 1e-9, leading to triangulation failure.
