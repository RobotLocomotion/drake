 * Solves an optimization program, with optional initial guess and solver
 * options. This function first chooses the best solver depending on the
 * availability of the solver and the program formulation; it then constructs
 * that solver and call the Solve function of that solver. The optimization
 * result is stored in the return argument.
 * @param prog Contains the formulation of the program, and possibly solver
 * options.
 * @param initial_guess The initial guess for the decision variables.
 * @param solver_options The options in addition to those stored in @p prog.
 * For each option entry (like print out), there are 4 ways to set that option,
 * and the priority given to the solver options is as follows (from lowest /
 * least, to highest / most):
 * 1. common option set on the MathematicalProgram itself
 * 2. common option passed as an argument to Solve
 * 3. solver-specific option set on the MathematicalProgram itself
 * 4. solver-specific option passed as an argument to Solve
 * @return result The result of solving the program through the solver.

 * done for every progs[i].
 *
 * Uses at most parallelism cores, with static scheduling by default.
 *
 * @param dynamic_schedule If dynamic_schedule is false then static scheduling
 * is used and so each core will solve approximately 1/parallelism of the
 * programs. This is most efficient when all the programs take approximately the
 * same amount of time to solve. If dynamic_schedule is true, then dynamic
 * scheduling is used and all the programs are queued into a single pool and
 * each core will take the next program off the queue when it becomes available.
 * This is best when each program takes a dramatically different amount of time
 * to solve.
 *
 * @note When using a proprietary solver (e.g. Mosek) your organization may have
 * limited license seats. It is recommended that the number of parallel solves
 * does not exceed the total number of license seats.
 *
 * @note Only programs which are thread safe are solved concurrently. Programs
 * that are not thread safe will be solved sequentially in a thread safe manner.
