/// A class for solving Linear Complementarity Problems (LCPs). Solving a LCP
/// requires finding a solution to the problem:<pre>
/// Mz + q = w
/// z ≥ 0
/// w ≥ 0
/// zᵀw = 0
/// </pre>
/// (where M ∈ ℝⁿˣⁿ and q ∈ ℝⁿ are problem inputs and z ∈ ℝⁿ and w ∈ ℝⁿ are
/// unknown vectors) or correctly reporting that such a solution does not exist.
/// In spite of their linear structure, solving LCPs is NP-Hard [Cottle 1992].
/// However, some LCPs are significantly easier to solve. For instance, it can
/// be seen that the LCP is solvable in worst-case polynomial time for the case
/// of symmetric positive-semi-definite M by formulating it as the following
/// convex quadratic program:<pre>
/// minimize:   f(z) = zᵀw = zᵀ(Mz + q)
/// subject to: z ≥ 0
///             Mz + q ≥ 0
/// </pre>
/// Note that this quadratic program's (QP) objective function at the minimum
/// z cannot be less than zero, and the LCP is only solved if the objective
/// function at the minimum is equal to zero. Since the seminal result of
/// Karmarkar, it has been known that convex QPs are solvable in polynomial
/// time [Karmarkar 1984].
///
/// The difficulty of solving an LCP is characterized by the properties of its
/// particular matrix, namely the class of matrices it belongs to. Classes
/// include, for example, Q, Q₀, P, P₀, copositive, and Z matrices.
/// [Cottle 1992] and [Murty 1998] (see pp. 224-230 in the latter) describe
/// relevant matrix classes in more detail.
