    """Declares a library with a uniform set of header files (typically just
    one header file) but with two different cc file implementations, depending
    on a configuration setting. This is how we turn on/off specific solver
    back-end implementations, e.g., `snopt_solver.cc` vs `no_snopt.cc`.

    The same hdrs are used unconditionally. The deps should list the
    dependencies for the header file(s), and thus are also unconditional.

    The opt_in_condition specifies the configuration setting that chooses
    which cc files to use.

    The sources listed in srcs_always contain definitions that are appropriate
    whether or not a back-end is enabled. This usually contains things such as
    the solver name, ID, and attribute support. The implementation_deps_always
    lists the dependencies of these files.

    The sources listed in srcs_enabled contain the code of the fully-featured
    implementation. The implementation_deps_enabled lists the dependencies of
    these files.

    The sources listed in srcs_disabled contain the alternative (stub)
    definitions that report failure (e.g., returning false or throwing).

    This rule enables linting of all of the mentioned source files, even if
    the compiler will not build them in the current configuration. We want all
    files to be lint-free, even when the commercial solvers are disabled.

    Additionally, declares a library {name}_disabled with the disabled flavor,
    intended for use by unit test checks of stub implementation even when the
    full implementation is enabled.
