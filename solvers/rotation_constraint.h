/// @file Functions for reasoning about 3D rotations in a @MathematicalProgram.
///
/// There are a number of choices for representing 3D rotations in a
/// mathematical program -- many of these choices involve using more than
/// the minimal three parameters and therefore require additional constraints
/// For example:
///  - the 4 parameters of a quaternion should form a vector with unit length.
///  - the 9 parameters of a rotation matrix should form a matrix which is
///    orthonormal (R.transpose() = R.inverse()) and det(R)=1.
///
/// Unfortunately, in the context of mathematical programming, most of these
/// constraints are non-convex.  The methods below include convex relaxations
/// of these non-convex constraints.

// TODO(all): Other concepts to potentially implement:
//  - PSDlift from section 1.2 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.4914.pdf .  This
//    is waiting on the symbolic expression tools.
//  - Principle minor SOCP relaxations of the SDP conditions
//  - MILP constraints that push outside the cube contained by the L2 ball,
//    with vertices at (sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(3)/3), (-sqrt(3)/3,
//    sqrt(3)/3, sqrt(3)/3), ... this would have 6 faces/binary variables per
//    column of R instead of the 8 in the L1 norm constraint.
//  - Axis angle and/or gaze cone constraints, as mentioned here:
// https://reviewable.io/reviews/robotlocomotion/drake/4653#-K_YGsAOBY5ooX3OBqo7
