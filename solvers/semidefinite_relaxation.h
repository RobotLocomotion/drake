/** Constructs a new MathematicalProgram which represents the semidefinite

 relaxations than programs using LinearConstraint or BoundingBoxConstraint,
 even if lower_bound == upper_bound. Prefer LinearEqualityConstraint.

/** A version of MakeSemidefiniteRelaxation that allows for specifying the
 * sparsity of the relaxation.
 *
 * For each group in @p variable_groups, the costs and constraints whose
 * variables are a subset of the group will be jointly relaxed into a single,
 * dense semidefinite program in the same manner as
 * MakeSemidefiniteRelaxation(prog).
 *
 * Each of these semidefinite relaxations are aggregated into a
 * single program, and their semidefinite variables are made to agree where the
 * variable groups overlap.
 *
 * The returned program will always have the same number of PSD variables as
 * variable groups.
 *
 * Costs and constraints whose variables are not a subset of any of the groups
 * are not relaxed and are simply added to the aggregated program. If these
 * costs and constraints are non-convex, then this method will throw.
 *
 * As an example, consider the following program.
 * min x₂ᵀ * Q * x₂ subject to
 * x₁ + x₂ ≤ 1
 * x₂ + x₃ ≤ 2
 * x₁ + x₃ ≤ 3
 *
 * And suppose we call
 * MakeSemidefiniteRelaxation(prog, std::vector<Variables>{{x₁, x₂}, {x₂,x₃}}).
 *
 * The resulting relaxation would have two semidefinite variables, namely:
 * [U₁,  U₂,  x₁]   [W₁,  W₂, x₂]
 * [U₂,  U₃,  x₂],  [W₂,  W₃, x₃]
 * [x₁ᵀ, x₂ᵀ,  1]   [x₂ᵀ, x₃ᵀ, 1]
 *
 * The first semidefinite variable would be associated to the semidefinite
 * relaxation of the subprogram:
 * min x₁ᵀ * Q * x₁ subject to
 * x₁ + x₂ ≤ 1
 * And the implied constraints from x₁ + x₂ ≤ 1 would be added to the first
 * semidefinite variable. These implied constraints are additional constraints
 * that can be placed on the matrix
 * [U₁,  U₂,  x₁]
 * [U₂,  U₃,  x₂]
 * [x₁ᵀ, x₂ᵀ,  1]
 * which are redundant in the non-convex program, but are not redundant in the
 * semidefinite relaxation. See
 * https://underactuated.mit.edu/optimization.html#sdp_relaxation for references
 * and examples.
 *
 * The second semidefinite variable would be associated to the semidefinite
 * relaxation of the subprogram:
 * min x₂ᵀ * Q * x₂ subject to
 * x₂ + x₃ ≤ 2
 * And the implied constraints from x₂ + x₃ ≤ 2 would be added to the second
 * semidefinite variable.
 *
 * Since the constraint x₁ + x₃ ≤ 3 is not a subset of any of the variable
 * groups, it will be added to the overall relaxation, but will not be used to
 * generate implied constraints on any semidefinite variable.
 *
 * The total relaxation would also include an equality constraint that U₃ == W₁
 * so that the quadratic relaxation of x₂ is consistent between the two
 * semidefinite variables.
 *
 * Note:
 * 1) Costs are only associated to a single variable group, so that the
 * resulting aggregated program has a relaxed cost with the same scaling.
 * 2) The homogenization variable "1" is re-used in every semidefinite variable.
 *
 * @throw std::exception if there is a non-convex cost or constraint whose
 * variables do not intersect with any of the variable groups.
