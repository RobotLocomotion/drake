/** Constructs a new MathematicalProgram which represents the semidefinite
 programming convex relaxation of the (likely nonconvex) program `prog`. This
 method currently supports only linear and quadratic costs and constraints, but
 may be extended in the future with broader support.

 See https://underactuated.mit.edu/optimization.html#sdp_relaxation for
 references and examples.

 Note: Currently, programs using LinearEqualityConstraint will give tighter
 relaxations than programs using LinearConstraint or BoundingBoxConstraint,
 even if lower_bound == upper_bound. Prefer LinearEqualityConstraint.

 @throws std::exception if `prog` has costs and constraints which are not
 linear nor quadratic.
