# Drake Tutorials

Drake offers Python-based tutorials using Jupyter notebooks.

We recommend that you
[view the tutorials online](https://deepnote.com/workspace/Drake-0b3b2c53-a7ad-441b-80f8-bf8350752305/project/Tutorials-2b4fc509-aef2-417d-a40d-6071dfed9199/notebook/index-753e3c9d261247ba9f0eb1d7868c18c8).

Alternatively, you may run the tutorials locally.

## Running the Tutorials Locally

To run the tutorials locally, install Drake via one of the [installation
methods](https://drake.mit.edu/installation.html) (e.g., [pip install
drake](https://drake.mit.edu/pip.html)), be sure your `PYTHONPATH` has been set
per the installation instructions, and then run `python3 -m pydrake.tutorials`
to launch a Jupyter browser.
