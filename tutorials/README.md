# Drake Tutorials

Drake offers Python-based tutorials using Jupyter notebooks.

The tutorials can be run online without any local installation, or are also
available via `pip` for running locally.

## Running the Tutorials Online

To host the tutorials online, we use Deepnote.  You may view a tutorial
without creating an account:

[![Deepnote](https://deepnote.com/buttons/launch-in-deepnote-white-small.svg)](https://deepnote.com/project/Tutorials-K0_FCa7yQX2kDWBx3-2RmQ/%2Findex.ipynb)

To run a tutorial interactively or to experiment with editing the code, click
the "Duplicate" button in the upper right while viewing. You'll be prompted to
create an account using Google, GitHub, or SSO. The button will duplicate the
entire suite of tutorials into your own personal Deepnote project.

## Running the Tutorials Locally

To run the tutorials locally, install Drake via one of the [installation
methods](https://drake.mit.edu/installation.html) (e.g., [pip install
drake](https://drake.mit.edu/pip.html)), be sure your `PYTHONPATH` has been set
per the installation instructions, and then run `python3 -m pydrake.tutorials`
to launch a Jupyter browser.

## For Developers

For instructions related to improving the tutorials or adding new ones,
