    "After constructing and solving an optimization problem through Drake's `MathematicalProgram` interface, you might not get the desired results. For example, you might expect the problem to have a solution, while `MathematicalProgram` reports that the problem is not solved successfully. In this tutorial we provide some tips to debug `MathematicalProgram` when it doesn't behave desirably.\n",

    "First you should understand whether the optimization problem is convex or not. For a convex problem (like LP, QP, SDP), when the problem is feasible, then theoretically the solver should always find a solution; on the other hand if the problem is non-convex and solved through gradient-based solvers (like SNOPT/IPOPT), then the solver might fail to terminate at a feasible solution even if one exists. When the gradient-based solver (like SNOPT/IPOPT) reports the problem being infeasible, it only means that the solver gets stuck at an infeasible value, and it doesn't know how to reduce the infeasibility in the local neighbourhood. A solution could exist far away from where the solver gets stuck, but the solver is trapped and can't jump to the distant solution. One possible solution is to choose a different initial guess of the optimization program.\n",
