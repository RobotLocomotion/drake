    "## Scene file formats: URDF and SDFormat\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important formats for creating multibody scenarios in Drake are the [Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf) and the [Simulation Description Format (SDFormat)](http://sdformat.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "They are both XML formats to describe robots or objects for robot simulators or visualization, and are fairly similar in syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a high-level sense, you express different components of your robot using `<link>` tags and connect them via `<joint>` tags. Each `<link>` has three major subtags, `<visual>`, `<collision>`, and `<inertial>`, for its visualization, planning/collision checking, and dynamics aspects. For `<visual>` and `<collision>`, you can either use primitives (box, sphere, cylinder, etc.) or meshes (.obj, .stl, and .dae) to represent the underlying geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some useful resources specifically for [URDF](http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/Tutorials/Building%20a%20Visual%20Robot%20Model%20with%20URDF%20from%20Scratch) and [SDFormat](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=build_model) creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### URDF vs. SDFormat\n",
    "\n",
    "While URDF is the standardized format in ROS, it's lacking many features to describe a more complex scene. For example, URDF can only specify the kinematic and dynamic properties of a single robot in isolation. It can't specify joint loops and friction properties. Additionally, it can't specify things that are not robots, such as lights, heightmaps, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "SDFormat was created to solve the shortcomings of URDF. SDFormat is a complete description for everything from the world level down to the robot level. This scalability makes it more suitable for sophisticated simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will primarily focus on leveraging SDFormat, but the differences in using URDF should be minimal with some syntax changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mesh file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a mesh file for any of your robot `<link>` entries, OBJ (`.obj`) is currently the best-supported format in Drake. If you have other file formats instead, [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/), an open-source software, is a handy tool to convert common formats to a `.obj` for you."

    "\n",
    "In the KUKA arm example, if you toggle the `drake/collision` checkbox in the MeshCat control panel a couple of times, you should see white boxes enveloping the KUKA arm appear and disappear. Those are the collision geometries defined in `iiwa7_with_box_collision.sdf` that are usually consumed by a motion planning or collision checking module when running the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we can use the same mesh to represent both the visual and collision geometry, approximating a complex mesh, like the KUKA arm, by primitive shapes can reduce the computation enormously. It's easier to check whether two cylinders collide than two irregular cylinder-like meshes. For that reason, we tend to load mesh files as the visual geometry but utilize various primitives as the collision geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Define collision geometry for your model\n",
    "\n",
    "As collision geometry is merely an approximation for the actual shape of your model, we want the approximation to be reasonably close to reality. A rule of thumb is to completely envelop the actual shape but not inflate it too much. For example, rather than trying to cover an L-shape model with one giant box, using two boxes or cylinders can actually better represent the shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a balancing act between the fidelity of the approximation and the computation cycles saved. When in doubt, start with a rough approximation around the actual shape and see if any undesired behavior is introduced, e.g., the robot thinks it's in a collision when it's apparently not. Identify the questionable part of the collision geometry and replace it with a more accurate approximation, and then iterate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use a mesh as collision geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases you need to have a detailed collision geometry for your simulation, e.g., in the case of dexterous manipulation for objects with an irregular shape, it might be justifiable to use a mesh as the collision geometry directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an OBJ mesh is served as the collision geometry for a basic contact model, i.e., the point contact model, Drake will internally compute the convex hull of the mesh and use that instead. If you need a non-convex collision geometry, it's suggested to decompose your mesh to various convex shapes via a convex decomposition tool. There are many similar tools available that are mostly thin wrappers on [V-HACD](https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd/). Among all, [convex_decomp_to_sdf](https://github.com/gizatt/convex_decomp_to_sdf) is a wrapper that we often use for Drake.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for a more complex contact model that Drake provides, such as the hydroelastic contact model, Drake can directly utilize the actual mesh for its contact force computation. Refer to [Hydroelastic user guide](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__hydroelastic__user__guide.html) for more information."

    "One common scenario for that is a lack of inertial properties for some of the simulated objects. The time step of the simulation may become extremely small (e.g., < 0.001s) due to the poorly specified system. Alternatively, you may receive an error message about `Delta > 0` or a warning that the inertial matrix is not physically valid.\n",
