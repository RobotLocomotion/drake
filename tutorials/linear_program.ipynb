Drake supports some solvers including SCS, Gurobi, MOSEK™, etc. Please see our [Doxygen page]( https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__solvers.html) for a complete list of supported solvers. Note that some commercial solvers (such as Gurobi and MOSEK™) are not included in the pre-compiled Drake binaries, and therefore not on Deepnote/Colab/Binder. \n",
