    "## Physically-based Rendering (PBR)\n",
    "\n",
    "An illumination model is an approximation of the physics behind the physical phenomena underlying vision -- electromagnetic radiation strikes materials and reflects towards a photo-sensitive medium (e.g., film, CCDs, human eyes, etc.) The so-called \"physically-based rendering\" illumination model is a modern model that hews more closely to actual physics (in comparison with older, classical illumination models). While it is truer to reality, it is still an approximation. There will inevitably be differences between renderings and reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What makes it physical?\n",
    "\n",
    "PBR's primary distinction is that it returns to the underlying physics of light:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It's based on a statistical model of how light interacts with materials at a microscopic level.\n",
    "  - It conserves energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "PBR provides concrete benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It allows content authors to create models based on an object's actual properties without concern about how the objects get used; the correctness of the material doesn't depend on the lighting.\n",
    "  - Simply put, it produces more realistic images.\n",
    "  \n",
    "To effectively light a scene, you need to understand the properties of the available light sources _and_ how materials respond to those light sources. For example, if you have an object painted with [Vantablack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vantablack) shining more light on the object will not appreciably change your final image. This tutorial provides a high-level discussion of the material properties and light sources available to you. If you're interested about the details of PBR, you might try [this tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/PBR/Theory) or [this documentation of a particular implementation](https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Enabling PBR in RenderEngineVtk\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussions below will be interleaved with interactive examples where you can explore the parameters discussed. We'll simply start with how to enable PBR illumination.\n",
    "\n",
    "`RenderEngineVtk` defaults to the Phong illumination model for historical reasons. This default will change in the future. In the meantime, there are three things that will change a `RenderEngineVtk` instance from Phong to PBR:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Explicitly request it in the [`RenderEngineVtkParams`](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/structdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_render_engine_vtk_params.html)\n",
    "    - Set the `force_to_pbr` flag to `true`.\n",
    "  - Add an [environment map](#environment_maps).\n",
    "  - Add at least one glTF file (Drake's preferred visual geometry representation) to the `RenderEngineVtk` instance. More specifically, add a `drake::geometry::Mesh` with `drake::geometry::PerceptionProperties` compatible with your `RenderEngineVtk` instance."

    "As we discuss the details of PBR and Drake, we'll do it in a context in which you can explore the parameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the code blocks in which you can modify parameters and re-evaluate, we've given you the ability to move the camera and re-render the image. We'll do that via an instance of meshcat visualizer. By moving the camera in the visualization browser window, the camera in this session will update its pose to match. It *does* require explicitly re-rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each render will print the command for setting the camera pose. If you change the camera to something you like and would like to consistently reproduce it, you can copy and paste the command into the render window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern you'll see over and over again is a pair of code blocks. The first will set up the scene -- with particular emphasis on the parameters being illustrated. It also sets a curated camera pose so that the first rendering you do will show what the tutorial needs to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second code block will simply perform the rendering (and contain the rendered result). The first evaluation will use the camera pose defined in the first block. Subsequent executions of the rendering block will use the pose from the meshcat session.\n",

Defining the light's `position` determines the emitted light rays' common origin and directions.\n",
    "  - __Spot light__: This is a point light with an opaque, conical light shade on it, parameterized by `drake::geometry::render::LightParameter`'s fields: `position`, `direction`, and `cone_angle`. Like a point light, it emits all light from a single point (located at `position`). However, there is an oriented cone associated with the spot light. The cone has its apex at `position` and it expands in the direction indicated by the `direction`  vector. Finally, the `cone_angle` controls how narrow the spot light's beam is. The angle (in degrees) specifies the _half_ angle of the cone's span, or the angle between the cone's central axis and the boundary of the cone. No light is emitted outside of this cone. \n",
    "  - __Directional light__: This can be thought of as a point light that is infinitely far away, or idealized sunlight; all emitted light rays are parallel. As such, the directional light has no meaningful value for `position`, but its `direction` value defines the direction of the emitted light rays.\n",

    "\n",
    "Light interacts with matter in various ways. While the physics is fascinating and intricate, rendering technology typically focuses on the _effects_ and creates algorithms that approximate many of the observable effects. The names you might see in this regard are such things as: \"diffuse\", \"specular\", \"ambient\", \"reflection\", \"refraction\", \"diffraction\", etc., This tutorial won't necessarily discuss all supported phenomenon. Instead, it will touch (and possibly elaborate) on those lighting effects that are most relevant to  exploring the rendering configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diffuse lighting\n",
    "\n",
    "When light strikes a surfaces, some portion of the light is reflected off of the surface and some portion is refracted into the surface. The light that  refracts into the surface may bounce around several times before bouncing out again.The bouncing is a random process. Even though a light ray may strike a surface from a specific direction, the final refracted light can end up shining in an arbitrary direction. Thus, from a viewer's perspective, the observed refracted light doesn't depend on which direction the light ray came from, but simply how much light struck the surface. Furthermore, the light color and intensity can be changed by this process (as some frequencies of light get filtered out and energy gets absorbed as part of the bouncing around).\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully account for this refracting phenomenon, we need to add up all of the light that can strike that surface point from any direction (this is, in fact, a hemisphere of directions; light rays coming from \"behind\" the surface point do not illuminate it). As we sum up all of the light sources and account for the energy loss and color shifts, we end up with the total refracted light emitted from the point on the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process \"diffuses\" the lighting shining onto the surface, blurring, tinting, and dimming it from the viewer's perspective. (Note: we'll discuss the reflected portion down below when we talk about \"specular\" reflections.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of \"how much light\" strikes the surface is affected by the intensity of the light sources and the angle at which the light ray strikes the surface. A light ray striking the surface perpendicularly will have the most energy. As the angle becomes shallower, the amount of light striking the surface will get smaller. This is computed based on the normal of the illuminated surface and the direction of light rays produced by each light type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a scene with a flat plane, we can see the different diffuse lighting effects that the three lights have. We'll render a flat plane with three different lights: a point light 5 meters above the plane, and a spot light 5 meters above the plane, shining straight down, and a directional light shining directly down on the plane."

    "There are some essential differences between the three images. Let's look at those differences and see how light choice effects them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious difference is the spot light's limit. It doesn't illuminate the full ground box. We see a circular pool of light. The light is circular because the spot light's cone of light intersects the ground perpendicularly. If the spot light were tilted, the pool of light would be elliptical. In `RenderEngineVtk`, the spot light's pool of light *always* has a hard edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more subtle difference is between the point light and directional light images. In both images, the ball's appearance is essentially the same. However, the ground box is different. With the point light, the ground nearest the ball is the most brightly illuminated. Away from the ball, the ground is much darker. In contrast, the ground box is the same color everywhere with the directional light. It's also worth pointing out that _within_ the pool of light, the spot light's pattern of illumination matches the point light. Why is the directional light different?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for a surface to be visible (to eye or camera), light must strike the surface. The more light that strikes it, the brighter the surface appears. Three light properties determine the amount of light striking the surface: direction, intensity and attenuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "For a beam of light with a fixed energy level, the portion of that energy that actually reflects off a surface depends on the angle at which the beam strikes the surface. If the light strikes the surface perpendicular to the surface, the energy (per unit area) is maximized. As the beam's approach direction diverges from perpendicular, less energy per unit area strikes the surface, so there's less to reflect. The surface will appear dimmer. As the light direction becomes parallel to the surface, the surface will not be illuminated at all. Obviously, any light beam coming from _behind_ an opaque surface will not illuminate it all.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how does that apply to the images above?\n",
    "\n",
    "The point light and directional light (and spot light, of course) have the same intensity. The point light is placed above the ball so that light striking the top of the ball strikes the ball perpendicularly. Similarly, the directional light is aimed straight down. That is why the ball in both images appears more or less identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we consider the ground far away from the ball, the relationship between surface orientation and light direction differs. By definition, the rays from the directional light are the same throughout the whole scene. That's why the ground has constant illumination across its visible surface. However, the direction from surface to point light changes as we move away from the center; less light is striking those areas because of the shallower angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try changing the direction of the directional light or the position of the point light in the previous rendering to see how illumination levels change. "

This attenuation of physical light follows the inverse-squared law -- if distance doubles, intensity falls to a quarter. The lights above have _no_ attenuation. The distance to the light has no bearing on light intensity. For truly realistic scene lighting, we should change the lights to have quadratic attenuation.\n",

A light's intensity gets attenuated based on the distance, `d`, between light source and illuminated point. The scale factor is:\n",

    "\n",
    "None of the previous renderings had any shadows. Everything was illuminated as if there were nothing between the surface and the light. In the real world, light can be _occluded_. Physical objects block the light, casting shadows onto surfaces that would otherwise have been lit. In rendering, we don't get occlusion for free. We create shadows through a variety of approximations. The spot light's cone of light is our first example. In the real world, that cone of light is created by a physical shade that blocks emitted light. The virtual spot light is simply modeled as a cone of light directly. However, this simplified cone model, while sufficient for creating a _pool_ of light, is insufficient for shadows.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple techniques to detect occlusion. `RenderEngineVtk` uses a technique called \"shadow maps\". Shadow maps are an encoding of surfaces that are visible *to the light source*. Any surface that is visible gets illuminated. Surfaces that are not visible are in shadow. A shadow map is a texture map (hence the name), where every pixel contains a value storing the distance of the closest surface in the direction of the pixel. These distance measurements are reconciled at rendering time to determine if a surface is in shadow or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shadow model is binary. A pixel is either visible from the light or not (up to possible numerical precision issues). Given that our lights are all modeled as point sources (more or less), this binary illumination classification means that all shadows will have hard edges; there is no blurry [penumbra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbra,_penumbra_and_antumbra).\n",

The entire space visible to the light is mapped to a single 2D image via a simple projection. If every possible shadow a light can cast projects onto a single plane, then that light can cast shadows. This is true for a spot light with `cone_angle < 90 degrees`. The plane whose surface normal is parallel with the light's directional vector can catch all of the shadows. But once the `cone_angle` value reaches 90-degrees, there are emitted light rays that are *parallel* to that plane. They will never intersect with the plane and therefore can't cast shadows onto it. In `RenderEngineVtk`, shadows are simply disabled for such spot lights.\n",

    "#### Shadow map registration\n",
    "\n",
    "It is one thing to define the resolution of the image that stores the shadow map. But what is the relationship of that image and the rendered world? In other words, how big are those pixels? The bigger the pixels, the more likely you are to notice the resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shadow map has to be \"registered\" to the world in some way -- defining which portion of the world is accounted for by the shadow map. The image is finite, the world is, in principle, infinite. So, only some *portion* of the world can be included in the domain of the shadow map. There are no parameters for controlling this domain of shadow coverage. So, how is it defined?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both shadow-casting lights have their domains automatically and dynamically computed on every rendering. At their core, each light determines the extent of those objects that *can* be illuminated by the light, and registers the shadow map to cover that full domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This domain is updated on a render-by-render basis to prevent objects moving in and out of regimes in which shadows can be cast. However, it means if the extent of the scene changes significantly from render to render, the shadows may qualitatively change as well (e.g., previously smooth shadows become blocky).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each shadow-casting light uses its own proprietary logic for determining the illuminated domain.\n",

    "\n",
    "![spotlight-shadow-registration](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/shadow_map_registration_spot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The spot light determines the domain of its shadow map (its light volume) by creating a view frustum. The frustum is oriented so that the near and far planes are perpendicular to the light's `direction` vector. The planes are scaled so that the cover the extent of the cone; the frustum is tapered towards the source. The near plane is directly in front of the light source itself. The far plane is moved away from the light's `position` in the light `direction` until it as far as the *farthest* scene element *in that direction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No matter how \"deep\" the scene is in the direction of the camera's view,    the shadow pixels at any depth will be the same size as the size of the pixels largely only depends on the *cone angle* of the light. So, simply fixing cone angle and then modifying the map resolution size will define the pixelation on the shadow boundaries.\n",
    "2. If the scene is \"deep\" in the direction of the camera's view, but we're only rendering the items nearest the camera, we will effectively have reduced precision in the depth calculations. This only affects thin objects piled on top of each other.\n",

    "##### Directional light registration\n",
    "![directional-shadow-registration](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/shadow_map_registration_directional.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Directional lights don't have finite extent. They can, in principle, cast light anywhere in the world. In this case, the extent of the illuminated domain is defined by the extent of the geometry that *can* be illuminated. Essentially, we create a bounding *cube* around all of the geometry aligned to the light's direction vector. The size of the cube face is the size of the shadow map in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The more the scene spreads out perpendicular to the light's direction, the more shadow map resolution you need. Rendering scenes with ground planes can cause the shadow volume to increase to enclose a volume much larger than the subject of the camera. This will require much higher shadow map resolution to get a good effect near the subject, wasting much of the shadow map resolution.\n",
    "2. If the shadow map gets \"stretched\" out because of the scene bound, it may    be that enabling shadows will produce no discernible effect. It may simply be that the shadow map has been stretched so large, that a shadow map pixel is larger than your target objects; they simply don't render into the shadow map.\n",

We're interested in how it _reflects_ off of surfaces to the camera. To understand that, we need to talk about how materials are modeled in the PBR model.

    "#### Microfacts and reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "We see **specular** reflections every day. These are the mirror-like reflections such that images of the environment are visible on the surface. Even some of the most non-mirror-like surfaces exhibit some degree of specular reflection -- dull concrete surfaces will still show highlights when you look at it from the right angle. Take a look at <a href=\"http://filmicworlds.com/blog/everything-is-shiny/\"> this site</a> to see how even the \"dullest\" objects have specular reflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physics of these reflections is conceptually simple. Light strikes a point on a surface (with an associated surface normal). The incoming light ray is reflected across the normal. If your eye is on the path of the outgoing ray, you see the reflected light. Another way of saying the same thing is to imagine the \"half-angle vector\" between the incoming light direction and the outgoing view direction. If that vector is aligned with the surface normal, you see a reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "![simple reflections](https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/simple_reflection.png)\n",
    "**Figure:** The light ray strikes the surface with normal _n_ from direction _l_. The three views _v₀_, _v₁_, and _v₂_ form half-angle vectors _h₀_, _h₁_, and _h₂_, respectively. Only _h₁_ aligns with _n_, so only view _v₁_ receives the specular reflection from the light source.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, surface reflectivity can vary widely. Some crisp and clear and others so subtle that you have to look carefully to notice it. These differences come down to the structure of the object surface at a microscopic level.\n",
    "\n",
    "No surface is perfectly smooth. At the microscopic level, irregularities in the material produce many different normals within a small region. As light strikes that region, light will get distributed in many directions simultaneously, based on the distribution of face normal directions. Shiny surfaces are more regular in structure. The majority of microfacets face the same way. Dull surfaces have more chaotic structure. The more coherency in microfacet direction there exists, the shinier the surface and the more distinct the reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect of this is twofold. First, perceived specular reflections from a highly irregular surface are both dimmer and blurrier. Dimmer, because the light from a single direction gets scattered in multiple directions simultaneously; only a small portion of the incoming light energy from a single direction gets reflected in the viewer's direction. Blurrier, because the light that *does* get reflected in the viewer's direction can come from a\n",
    "larger span of angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "PBR takes a statistical approach to accounting for these microfacets. A single rendered pixel may encompass millions of microfacets. So, in PBR, we describe a surface's \"roughness\". At any given point on the surface, there is an attendant roughness value. From this roughness value, we can determine what portion of the microfacets are aligned with the half-angle vector, _h_. Let's see what that looks like."

    "##### Clarifications on specular reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The light sources described above are all, in some sense, point lights. As the surface gets smoother (roughness going to zero), the reflection becomes a more exact reflection. Mathematically, when roughness is zero, the specular reflection of light sources are mathematical points. These points would *not* appear in the rendering; the measure of the point is infinitely small. This is correct, with respect to the PBR model, but counterintuitive when modeling the physical world. When computing the specular reflection from *direct* light sources, Drake makes sure the specular highlight does not completely disappear.\n",
    "2. The lighting model does *not* include specular reflections of one geometry in the surface of another. Getting mirrored surfaces that reflect other geometry requires a different kind of technique -- one that `RenderEngineVtk` does not support yet. So, the only specular reflections we will see are those from scene artifacts that are considered to be light sources, e.g., the [explicit lights](#direct_lighting) described above and the [environment maps](#environment_maps) described below.\n",
    "3. Specular reflections always depend on three things: the direction the light ray comes from when striking the surface, the orientation of the surface (its normal direction), _and_ the direction from the surface to the camera.\n",
    "4. When light strikes a surface at a \"grazing\" angle, the surface exhibits greater reflectivity (called\n",

    "    - Specular reflections get heavily tinted by the metal's intrinsic color (its \"albedo\"). If you look at gold, copper, etc., you'll see the reflections in those materials have been tinted to the metal's underlying color.\n",
    "  - **dielectric**\n",
    "    - Dielectric materials exhibit diffuse reflection. Light does escape from the surface away from the specular reflections.\n",
    "    - Specular reflections tend to be dimmer than with metallic materials (the ratio of how much light gets reflected vs. refracted is much lower). Furthermore, the reflections are not tinted by the material's albedo.\n",

    "This time we've put the camera between the two spheres and the red light in the environment map. We can still clearly see the specular reflection of the white light and the red light in the smooth sphere on the left. The rough sphere on the right has no such specular reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this image illustrates two additional phenomena: Fresnel reflections and diffuse illumination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fresnel reflection is apparent in the smooth sphere. We can see the blue light reflected on the rim of the smooth sphere. The fact that the sphere reflects the blue light is expected. But the fact that the reflection of the blue light is more *intense* than the white or red lights might be surprising. The light striking the surface at a grazing angle experiences greater reflectivity so we observe a more intense reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both spheres have a reddish tint that covers a large portion of the side of the sphere. If you move the camera in Meshcat to look at the blue sides of the spheres and re-render, you'll see a similar blue tint on the other side. This is the environment map's contribution to the diffuse lighting effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, diffuse illumination is the portion of radiant energy that comes from the portion of the light that strikes the surface, refracts inwards, bounces around and, finally is partially emitted again. The _total_ diffuse effect is the sum of all such light. If there's a light source from _any_ direction that can strike a point on the surface, it must be included in the diffuse calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, for any given point on the sphere, half of the environment map is able to shine light onto the sphere (it is the hemisphere of the environment centered on the point and arrayed around the surface normal at that point). Because of the integral and the energy-conserving properties of the PBR model, the total contribution of the environment map on the diffuse lighting is a blurred and dimmed version of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effect can also be thought of as a form of \"ambient\" lighting. When light is shined into a room, the light doesn't simply leave the light source and strike a single surface before bouncing to your eye. The light bounces many, many times. With each bounce the reflected light can change in character. Light simply moves so fast that we can't observe this phenomenon; we merely see the steady state of the light having bounced everywhere. This is the reason why surfaces can be illuminated even if the light source can't shine directly onto the surface; there is \"indirect\" lighting that does shine onto it. This indirect lighting is the \"ambient\" light of the environment."

    "### High-Dynamic Range (HDR) Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all images can serve equally well as environment maps. A typical image -- one typically seen as part of a webpage -- uses \"normalized\" color. That means the value for each pixel is a value in the range [0, 1] (or [0, 255] depending on encoding). The environment map above uses just such an image. Normalized color is sufficient for communicating *basic* color information (hue, saturation, etc.) but it has limited ability to communicate the full _dynamic_ range of radiant _energy_ possible. While physical light has varying frequency (signalling color in our minds), it also has _intensity_. An ideal environment map is one that can encode both color _and_ intensity. High-dynamic range (HDR) images use _unnormalized_ color data. They still communicate color properties (again, hue, saturation, etc.), but they also encode intensity. The range between the dimmest and brightest portions of the environment map can be arbitrarily large (as it is in most human environments). We frequently don't notice the wide range of intensities because our eyes and brains are good at taking a wide range of light levels and creating a coherent image in a narrow range of energy levels. Cameras typically have a smaller dynamic range than the human optical system, so photographers are always worrying about shutter speed, film speed, and aperture to control how much light energy the image medium is exposed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is of critical importance when it comes to curating environment maps. Environment maps encoded in normalized color images (e.g., png, jpg, bmp, etc.) will have a different impact on the rendering than an unnormalized color image (.hdr). In an environment map, a light intensity is associated with each pixel. Light intensity can be characterized with various units. We'll use watts (W) as being reasonably correlated with the _brightness_ of the light. For a normalized image, the maximum energy at _every_ pixel, regardless of color, is 1 W (pure white pixels); colors with less value (darker colors) implicitly have less energy with pure black being the only zero-energy pixel. To put that in context, in real world scenarios, intensity can range multiple orders of  magnitude between the darkest and brightest light sources. That has two implications for normalized color images:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The maximum intensity of 1 W is quite dim compared to the real world.\n",
    "  - They provide almost _no_ lighting contrast. What contrast exists usually comes from the _colors_ in the image and the general correlation with low intensity light sources manifesting as dark colors to film and sensors. As counter-intuitive as it might seem, a pixel with _dark_ normalized color (0.01, 0.01, 0.01) is putting out 1 W of light, just like a white pixel. It's just 1 W of essentially \"black\" light (but not in the \"all-night rave\" sense of the word)."

    "\n",
    "We need to take a brief detour to understand how high dynamic range images get drawn to your screen (and saved as normalized color images).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the images above, the image using the 1-watt .png image has 1/120th the light energy as the image rendered with the 120-watt environment map. And yet, the \"dim\" image is not simply a copy of the bright image with each pixel having 1/120th the value of the original. If that were the case, the image would just be near-black silhouettes of the balls against a black background. However, the balls are _not_ silhouettes. There is still visible gradation of light communicating the rounded shape of the balls. In fact, the dim, 1-watt image shows more of the spherical shape for the bottom row of balls than the oversaturated 120-watt image. So, what's happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is \"tone mapping\". It's the process by which an image with \"unbounded\" intensity levels gets mapped to an image (or display) with normalized color. The mapping is not _strictly_ linear. Generally, near the darkest and brightest features, there is non-linear tapering in attempt to preserve details at the extremes of illumination. Furthermore, as the images show above, the tone mapping function has a finite range -- intensity values outside of that range produce the saturated white pixels we've seen in some of the previous images.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, in fact, various possible mapping functions. `RenderEngineVtk` uses the <a href=\"https://www.kitware.com/pbrj1/\">\"Generic Filmic tone mapping operator with the \"Uncharted2\" parameter values</a>. There are multiple parameters associated with that operator. To keep things simple, Drake exposes a single parameter: `exposure`. If you are familiar with photography, exposure plays a similar role in rendering as it does in photography. It is essentially a way to control how much the \"film\" is exposed to the the scene's radiant energy. Expose it less and the final image is darker. Expose it more, and the image is brighter. Go too far in either direction, and the final image can either be a dark mess or a washed out blur of whiteness. In `RenderEngineVtk`, `exposure` is simply a scale factor applied to the image prior to performing the non-linear mapping. So, if a pixel in the resulting image is reflecting 10 W to the camera, an `exposure` value of 0.5 will mean we map a 5-watt intensity at that pixel. The default value for `exposure` is 1. Images that are too dark should increase exposure and images that are too bright should reduce exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's clear in the above image that the image using the 1-watt .png image is underexposed (three of the four balls are obviously underlit). At the same time, the image using the 120-watt .hdr image is overexposed. Let's render the images again, but this time tune the exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exposure values below, have been selected so that the _top_ of the rough, dielectric sphere basically appears the same in all images. (We'll come back to the question of how do you pick exposure values later.)"

There is a non-zero amount of illumination which has been scaled by a factor of 7.5, pushing it far enough from black that when the subsequent tone mapping is applied, \"black\" has become medium grey.

    "In all five images, the rough dielectric balls are basically the same.\n",
    "This has understandably led to attendant changes in the other balls.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple important lessons to draw from the images above.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balance**: The images with the 0.1-watt and 100-watt lights show massive imbalance between the direct lights and the environment map. In the 0.1-watt image, the spot light has almost no effect (only the faintest of shadows can be seen below the spheres). In the 100-watt image, the light outshines the environment map by so much, that the perfect specular reflections in the smooth metallic ball have been almost entirely eliminated by the tone mapping. The fundamentally dimmer specular reflections in the smooth dielectric ball _have_ been eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the 1-watt and 2-watt (and even the 7.5-watt) images show a better balance between direct illumination and environment map.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Materials**: The mirror ball is not just perfectly smooth (`roughness` = 0), but it is also metallic. Metallic materials are unaffected by diffuse light  effects, including from the environment map. The appearance of metallic\n",
    "surfaces are dominated by specular reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the material were non-metallic instead, in addition to the specular reflection attributable to its smoothness, it would also be illuminated by the diffuse and ambient lights. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the two rough spheres (on the right) appear similar. If metallic balls don't get diffuse light, how is the rough metallic sphere so brightly illuminated? Does the roughness somehow cause diffuse lighting effects? No. It is still only specular reflection, but the roughness has caused the reflection to become so blurred, that it has a diffusive-effect. What you'll notice if you move the camera, is that the appearance of the rough metallic ball will change as the camera moves, whereas the rough dielectric ball remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exposure values**: The baseline image uses an image consistently described in this tutorial as having a \"7.5-watt white light\". And yet, when we add a 1-watt or 2-watt light to the scene, we have to reduce the exposure to 0.55 and 0.4, respectively. And when we add a 7.5-watt spot light, the exposure drops all the way down to 0.11 all in the name of normalizing the appearance of the top of the rough sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we said that the exposure is simply a scale factor on the surface's reflected radiant energy. If the environment map has a 7.5-watt top light and we add another 7.5-watt direct light, why would we have to reduce the exposure to ten percent of its original value and not simply half? Conversely, by adding a 1-watt or 2-wat light, we reduced the exposure to around half which implies that the intensity of the environment on the top of the ball was approximately 1-2 W.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed that the diffuse illumination contributed by the environment map is the result of finding the average light over the hemisphere associated with the surface point and normal. The hemisphere is large and the white light is small (speaking as solid angles). Therefore, the diffuse intensity is  significantly lower than the peak intensity in some portion of the hemisphere. If the white light were larger, spanning a larger solid angle, more energy would bleed out as diffuse illumination. In this case, averaging the red, white, and blue light sources with the dark background produces a peak diffuse intensity of only about 1-2 watts from the environment map.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means you can't determine compatible intensities for *direct* lights just by looking at the peak intensities in the environment map.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do you pick intensity values for your lighting? For now, tinkering."

    "The foggy background is now gone. Try moving the meshcat camera and re-render the scene. Try some of the following angles:\n",

    "  - Look at the table across from the window (so that you can see the window in the rendering).\n",
    "  - Do the same, but face the room's door.\n",

    "  \n",
    "In two of those views, the background seems to be overly dark. However, when looking at the robot arm and the window in the same rendering, the background and scene elements seem far more well balanced. Why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's primarily due to the light intensity. Before we apply tone mapping (via the `exposure` parameter), we first collect the amount of light energy at each pixel. When we put the camera at the window and look at the table, we see the window's *full* light contribution reflecting off the scene's objects. *Behind* those objects, however, we have a wall which contributes very little light in comparison. Therefore, when we apply the tone mapping, the brightest part of the image (the foreground elements) look just right, and the background gets pushed closer to black.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the table with the window *behind* the table, both the window's light energy and the highlights on the table, robot, etc. have a similar intensity. So, they get treated in a very similar way by the tone mapping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an inherent problem with environment maps. Their *true* purpose is to serve as a source of lighting to the objects in the scene. Also using it as a backdrop in the scene may not have the desired result. So, what can be done?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest solution is to actually put in a background; objects that can actually reflect the same light as the foreground elements.\n",
