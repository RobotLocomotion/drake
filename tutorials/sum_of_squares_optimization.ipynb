    "## Background\n",
    "Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization is a special type of convex optimization. This type of optimization is formulated as a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem, which can be solved through several solvers supported by Drake's MathematicalProgram.\n",
    "\n",
    "A polynomial $p(x)$ is sum-of-squares if\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p(x) = \\sum_i q_i(x)^2\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where each $q_i(x)$ is also a polynomial of the indeterminates $x$. $p(x)$ being sum-of-squares is a *sufficient* condition for $p(x)$ being non-negative for all $x$. In some cases it is also a necessary and sufficient condition. For more details on the relationship between sum-of-squares and non-negativity of a polynomial, you could refer to Chapter 3 of [Semidefinite Optimization and Convex Algebraic Geometry](http://www.mit.edu/~parrilo/sdocag/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A polynomial $p(x)$ being sum-of-squares is equivalent to the existence of a positive semidefinite (psd) matrix $Q$, such that\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "p(x) = z(x)^T Q z(x), Q\\succeq 0\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $z(x)$ contains all the monomials of $x$ up to a certain degree. If $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $p(x)$ has degree $2d$, then $z(x)$ contains all the monomials of $x$ up to degree $d$, namely the $z(x)$ has size ${{n+d}\\choose{d}}$. So searching for a sum-of-squares polynomial $p(x)$ is equivalent to searching for a positive semidefinite matrix $Q$, with the additional constraint that the polynomials $z(x)^TQz(x)$ and $p(x)$ are the same (they have the same coefficients).\n",

    "## Solving sum-of-squares problem\n",
    "In sum-of-squares problem, often we want to find a sum-of-squares polynomial that satisfies certain additional properties. Note that there are two different types of variables in sum-of-squares problems, the *indeterminates* and *decision variables*.\n",
    "* Decision variables: the coefficients of the polynomial are affine functions of our decision variables. We are optimizing over the decision variables.\n",
    "* Indeterminates: variables that can take any value. In the example above $x$ is an indeterminate -- the constraints that we write must hold $\\forall x$, we are *not* optimizing over these indeterminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some functions commonly used in sum-of-squares optimization within Drake's MathematicalProgram. We list some of them here\n",
    "* `MathematicalProgram.NewIndeterminates` Declares and returns new indeterminates.\n",
    "* `MathematicalProgram.AddSosConstraint` Imposes sum-of-squares (SOS) constraint on a polynomial.\n",
    "* `MathematicalProgram.NewSosPolynomial` Creates and returns a new polynomial, and constrain this polynomial to be sum-of-squares (SOS).\n",
    "* `MathematicalProgram.NewFreePolynomial` Creates and returns a new polynomial. No constraint has been imposed on this polynomial yet.\n",
    "* `MathematicalProgram.AddEqualityConstraintBetweenPolynomials` imposes the linear constraint that two polynomials are equal (they have the same coefficients for matching monomials).\n",

    "We will describe the details of each function later. First let's look at some examples"
